Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.


Our Hopes and Regards,
The HP Reverb Reddit Community.

*Editing new info the post as I complete more research*",HP's newest VR headset does not work with many X-570 motherboards. B-550 and X-470 affected as well.
Amd,"As one of the ""lucky"" few who got a RX 6800, I find it's the gift that keeps on giving \[problems\].

What the heck is up with RDNA and DX9? I have found folks having problems with DX9 games going back to RX 5700 launch.

I personally have been trying to play Final Fantasy 13. It constantly crashes, even when attempting ""fixes"" (a D3D9 to Vulkan wrapper, seriously).

I wouldn't be so miffed if this were a ""one off"", but it appears to be affecting multiple DX9 titles and has not been fixed for over a year. What???",RDNA + DX9 - What the heck is going on here?
Amd,"It seems like ever since RX 480/580 there hasn't been a gpu worth considering at this price point, RX 5500 was kinda fine for new builds, but that's it. And then there are news articles calling $400 cards a budget option. What the hell happened to $200 being midrange?",Are $200 GPUs dead?
Amd,"I was so excited to get a PS5 and build a new gaming desktop with AMD HW to settle in for a winter of gaming.

It's been so stressful trying to beat bots, scalpers, follow the right twitter (wtf on this one), refresh pages for 20 minutes only to come up empty handed... I've just given up. I don't care anymore; I'm going to wait until Jan/Feb when everything is in stock and I don't have to play into a rat-race casino to *spend* my money.

I'd literally rather just not have a nice gaming setup than deal with the stress required to get one this year.",Anybody else completely burnt out on trying to buy hardware and just waiting until next year?
Amd,"I should have received my 6800 through DHL Express (from Netherlands to Germany) on Thursday. I found out there was an unsuccessful delivery attempt and did some investigating. 

My name contains a letter that is not in the English alphabet and the system changed it to something nonsensical on the package. Had to call DHL Express support to change my name and make another attempt. 
The lady also told me that they would have held the package for 2 weeks if I wanted to come and pick it up. 

[You can check DHL Express info through this link!](https://www.dhlparcel.nl/en/business/my-shipment)

**TLDR:
Check your delivery status to see if the name is correct.**",Beware of using names with uncommon letters when ordering from AMD.com.
Amd,"I know AMD recommends a 750w psu, but I wanted to know if a 650w gold psu will work. And, I'm asking on the hypothetical of a ryzen 5 3600 and rx 6800xt (I know it's not exactly the most effective to pair it with a 3000 series chip).

Thanks.",Will a 650w gold psu be enough for a 6800xt?

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+",Games Under 100fps feels like im playing under 60 fps

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+",Games Under 100fps feels like im playing under 60 fps
Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### Where can you get this test version?
- Windows: [Installer](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.exe) [Archive (.7z)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z) [Archive (.zip)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.zip)

Install guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki/Installation).

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+",Games Under 100fps feels like im playing under 60 fps

Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### Where can you get this test version?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong.

Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)

1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:

    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

I personally have been trying to play Final Fantasy 13. It constantly crashes, even when attempting ""fixes"" (a D3D9 to Vulkan wrapper, seriously).

I wouldn't be so miffed if this were a ""one off"", but it appears to be affecting multiple DX9 titles and has not been fixed for over a year. What???",RDNA + DX9 - What the heck is going on here?
Amd,"It seems like ever since RX 480/580 there hasn't been a gpu worth considering at this price point, RX 5500 was kinda fine for new builds, but that's it. And then there are news articles calling $400 cards a budget option. What the hell happened to $200 being midrange?",Are $200 GPUs dead?

I don't care anymore; I'm going to wait until Jan/Feb when everything is in stock and I don't have to play into a rat-race casino to *spend* my money.

I'd literally rather just not have a nice gaming setup than deal with the stress required to get one this year.",Anybody else completely burnt out on trying to buy hardware and just waiting until next year?
Amd,"PC specs:

Monitor: 144hz 1440p lg27gl832

GPU: 5700xt

CPU: ryzen 5 3600

ram: 2x8gb 3600mhz

&amp;#x200B;

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+",Games Under 100fps feels like im playing under 60 fps
Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

I personally have been trying to play Final Fantasy 13. It constantly crashes, even when attempting ""fixes"" (a D3D9 to Vulkan wrapper, seriously).

I wouldn't be so miffed if this were a ""one off"", but it appears to be affecting multiple DX9 titles and has not been fixed for over a year. What???",RDNA + DX9 - What the heck is going on here?

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+",Games Under 100fps feels like im playing under 60 fps
Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

Monitor: 144hz 1440p lg27gl832

GPU: 5700xt

CPU: ryzen 5 3600

ram: 2x8gb 3600mhz

&amp;#x200B;

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+",Games Under 100fps feels like im playing under 60 fps
Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### Where can you get this test version?
- Windows: [Installer](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.exe) [Archive (.7z)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z) [Archive (.zip)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.zip)
- Ubuntu 18.04: [Archive (.7z)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-ubuntu-18.04-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z) [Archive (.zip)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-ubuntu-18.04-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.zip)
- Ubuntu 20.04: [Archive (.7z)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-ubuntu-20.04-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z) [Archive (.zip)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-ubuntu-20.04-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z)
- Or alternatively on [Github](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/actions/runs/389288556)

Install guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki/Installation).

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!

##Now get to posting!",Q4'20 Tech Support Megathread
Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### Where can you get this test version?
- Windows: [Installer](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.exe) [Archive (.7z)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z) [Archive (.zip)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.zip)

Install guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki/Installation).

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong.

Amd,"I think it is pretty clear that the debacle of the RDNA2 6000 series launch having been in orders of magnitude worse than Nvidia RTX 3000 series begs the question. I mean, it was (and is) so bad that AIBs have taken it upon themselves to directly dig even further the Rx 6000 series with insane prices of the AIB models and some retailers in Europe are straight up scalping these cards despite having no stocks. 

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro. So, in Germany you can get scalped with all the perks of buying directly from a retailer. 

I think it is time to call it for what it is: RDNA2 6000 series is a paper launch.

Amd,"Hey guys! I’ve been super lucky to pick up a RTX 3080 and a 5800x! Wanted to share some tips and tricks I have found to help the community out. Please upvote this if it helps you out.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

Amd,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share that I've got a Ryzen 5 2600 up and running on an MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard. Here is a CPU-Z validation: [https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq](https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq)

I'm creating this post, because I couldn't find enough information, if the motherboard will work with my CPU. Officially, the CPU is not supported by the motherboard (and from the B550 Chipset in general), but I found some comments here on Reddit and other forums that it might work, so I decided to give it a try. Here is what I had to do however, in order to get everything up and running.

Initially, the motherboard didn't boot with the Ryzen 5 2600. I decided to try and update the BIOS with MSI's Flashback to the latest BIOS version 7C91v14. With the CPU still in the socket, the Flashback didn't work as well, although theoretically it should work even with an installed CPU. The red LED for the Flashback blinked multiple times and then stayed solid for over 10 minutes and the other lights on the motherboard didn't light up, which meant that the Flashback isn't working.

I had to remove absolutely everything (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU) from the motherboard and leave only the 8 PIN CPU power connector and the 24 PIN power connector. After the BIOS flash, I installed the CPU, RAM, GPU and SSD and the PC booted without any problems. Everything (PCI-E Gen 3 including NVMe, SATA, XMP Profiles, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) seems to be working fine for now. The CPU is also recognized in the BIOS correctly.

One small note about using the Flashback: The USB drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and an MBR scheme. The flash might not work, if the scheme is not MBR.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I'll try to answer them.",Ryzen 5 2600 running on MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi
Amd,They're charging 899€ which is roughly 1075USD. Yes sir over a thousand dollars for the 6800. [Link](https://www.alternate.be/GIGABYTE/Radeon-RX-6800-16G-grafische-kaart/html/product/1694767?lk=21528),Scalpernate (belgium) at it again with the 6800.
Amd,"So I am curious what everyone thinks about the match up between these two cards now that AIB prices are released. Given the fact that the price of most AIB 6800 XTs are at or higher than the RTX 3080s, is it even worth it to go for AMD this generation? I know that the 6000 series has made great leaps forward with raw rasterization performance, but given that they don't outright beat nvidia and the rtx cards offer DLSS and functuonal ray tracing, I have trouble seeing how one would go for a 6800 XT over a 3080. What do you think?",AIB Prices: 6800 XT vs RTX 3080

**TL:DR**

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

So hold off from buying an older ryzen processor which I thought I was gonna have to do.

Amd,"Disclaimer: sorry if this is a little ranty.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted. 

What are your opinions?

Should I go for the 5800x or the 5900x?

Amd,"I have been eyeing the PN50 (specifically the 4800U) ever since it was announced and been unable to find stock anywhere.  I have an aging BRIX that won't stay booted on me anymore and really wanted a Ryzen replacement. I'd seen a few PN50 videos here and there so I knew it was out there, but was still unable to find it available for purchase.

I happened across the SimplyNUC Aspen, which is just a PN50 barebones with some components installed to make it functional. I attempted to order from their website and while it appeared there was stock to purchase, I was having trouble getting the item into the cart.

The site has an online chat, so I connected with Greg who was very helpful.  I was looking for a 64GB 2TB unit but found that the 64GB was not 3200, so I bought the cheapest model (4GB, 128GB M.2) with the expectation to buy better stuff on Newegg.

He said very clearly and confidently that they would ship in 2 to 3 business days and that he could send me a link to complete the order.  I paid at the link and for ovenight shipping (on a Wednesday) and went to Newegg to buy my 64GB HyperX and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2.  

I received my memory on Friday and my M.2 on Saturday.  On the 3rd business day (Monday before Thanksgiving) I messaged again to make sure that I would be receiving my computer on Tuesday as I was leaving the country on Sunday and knew packages wouldn't arrive on turkey day.

Unfortunately, the rep Piper told me that none were in stock.  They had received stock, but not nearly enough for the outstanding orders and that I would not be receiving my product until sometime in December.  She suggested I reach out to Greg to find out why I was guaranteed one in 3 days.

I emailed Greg who was very apologetic and was going to get to the bottom of it.  I heard back saying that they only had the 4700U in stock and would happily send me that and refund the difference, but that the 4800U would not be in stock until the first week of December.  He also offered to cancel the order outright but since I had already spent 600 bucks on the memory and drive, I was not too excited about that idea.  I told him I'd sleep on it and let him know.

The next day I saw Gigabyte announce their new BRIX S with Ryzen 4800U so now I had a dilemma on my hands.  I loved my BRIX, but I really didn't want to get stuck in the same loop I did with the PN50 due to availability issues, so I decided to stick it out if I was ""guaranteed"" one in December.  I'd arrive back in the country before Christmas and was resolved to wait it out.

I emailed Greg and he said it was extremely likely it would come in the first or second week of December so I agreed to wait. 

On Thanksgiving day however, I received a very odd phone call from FedEx saying I had a package on the way and to be there Friday to sign for it.  I checked my email and saw that sure enough, SimplyNUC had sent me a fedex from their Austin offices on Thanksgiving day.  I crossed my fingers but did not want to get my hopes too high that my 4800U was in transit.

Friday about 10am I hear a knock on the door and lo and behold there is a box from SimplyNUC with a PN50 inside.  And after close inspection it was my beloved 4800U.  They managed to get me one before I left the country after all.  

I will say that through all of the communication with Greg and Piper, they were terrific to work with. They were very apologetic and wanting to work with me for the best possible outcome even if it wasn't my first choice outcome.   Thanks much to SimplyNUC for getting me my perfect system just in time for my travel.

Oh, and the PN50?  I'm very pleased with it so far.  It's so much faster and quieter than my BRIX, even setting the fans to performance mode.  I couldn't be happier.

&lt;rant&gt; 

I purchased a new Ryzen CPU on the launch date within the first two minutes. (I used multiple computers with the same account to get that small advantage in case one lagged). At the moment of purchase, I was given an ETA of about a week. Which I thought was very quick. 

Then upon checking daily on their website, I found out it date was changed to the week after.

Again, no big deal, there is a pandemic going on. I checked my email and received no correspondence (typical for PLE they expect that you check their website). 

So the date came around and I got ready to go pick it up, and just before leaving I checked their website and they had changed the date to the week after that, again in typical PLE fashion without email correspondence on the date.

Currently it has been 24 days after the launch and nearing a week after my last ETA, with no real reason as to why it took this long nor a reason why my 3 ETAs were not accurate. They promised thousands of units on launch day but I’m still unsure why I, as a customer, was treaded this badly. Am I overreacting and entitled? I mean I did spend a very large sum of money (for me) with them so :/

Without making identifying comments, this has happened to me before, for other products (that aren’t as popular), with PLE and their perpetual ETAs. I hope I get something at the end of this.

There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

Amd,"We have taken a look at the 13.3-inch subnotebook Lenovo IdeaPad S540. We were once again surprised by the currently outstanding performance of the Ryzen processors. Thanks to this, the laptop received a very good rating despite the manufacturer having cut a few cut corners.

The Lenovo IdeaPad S540 is a very performative office laptop with all-round potential and a price tag of 750 Euro (~$900) despite the manufacturer cutting one or two corners along the way.

We were somewhat annoyed by the display: While it certainly isn't bad, it can't keep up with the results of last year's panel. Contrast and the black value, for example, have become less good and even the brightness distribution isn't what it was. Presumably, Lenovo wanted to save a little money with the new panel. 

Another thing Lenovo was a little stingy about is the SSD: Although again this isn't a bad model, the Western Digital SSD can't quite keep up with the Samsung PM981 SSD in the device's predecessor.

Both these changes do not make the new S540 a bad laptop and the alternative hardware still is fine. Plus, the new IdeaPad 540 now features a new AMD Ryzen processor that is really impressive. The Ryzen 5 4600U in this device is almost twice as fast as the Ryzen 5 3550H in the predecessor. The Intel Core i5-1035G7 cannot even pretend to keep up with AMD's CPU.

Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

&amp;#x200B;

I backordered the 5900x on release day at the Burnaby, BC, CanadaComputers location. While paying for the backorder deposit, I naturally asked the employees to check how many people are ahead of me in line for the 5900x. An separate employee that wasn't helping me at the cash register proudly shouted out 'FIVE! There's 5 backorders so far'. (Back orders are per store and not linked with online order or other stores).

So I was quite content being with #6. Thinking on the next resupply I'll have a high chance of getting one. Today I walked in to buy a motherboard and check on the backorder queue/status. Guy that assisted me checked my backorder position and said I am **TENTH** in line. Now, I immediately knew what shady shit happened. Even though employee says they must've just made a mistake or system broken. I am certain that some shady employees fixed the backorder positions up for their friends or family.

There's no way that guy that so proudly shouted out (when not even being asked directly since his not the one assisting me) the amount of backorders their store got on the 5900x is wrong. On top of that, the way this employee checked and then whimpering-ly told me ""You are 10th in line"". It just screams to me that his not the one fixing the backorder positions but he knows it's been fixed by someone and others have came checking their backorder positions and he had to tell them the same shit. Then having deal with the angry customer after. Now I knew there's nothing I could do about it, so I just expressed how fucked up that was with a few words and then left.

Somehow I wasn't too surprised, knowing even their store managers are scalping shit for themselves before anyone can even buy them.Some extra info he checked for me: (This is for Canada, BC)

There's 12 5900x in-transit to the Grandview CC store.

There's 8 5900x in-transit to the most of the rest of the CC stores. (Cool they just happen to have made me #10 in line huh)

Roughly 50 5900x in-transit to CC stores across BC. It will arrive in 1-2 weeks. Next batch zero ETA.

Amd,"There have been some whispers through the grapevine in many internet communities about a sad, wrong, and mean practice that I can only describe as pure evil. Folks, today I learned that there are people out there that use software tools to *derail* eBay listings for scalped graphics cards. Yes, that's right... people are using software to give themselves an unfair advantage in the exchange of PC hardware from manufacturers to consumers! WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING!?  For example, [see this well-known, already completed, eBay auction](https://www.ebay.com/bfl/viewbids/174530868878) from days ago. Evil cyber criminals decimated this totally innocent and honest listing with dozens of fake bids. They bidded so rapidly, the lister couldn't even [cancel them](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/cancelling-bid?id=4140) all - So sad!

Doing this isn't a good idea because it could get your account banned from eBay... unless you were to use, say, a [VPN service](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-vpn-service-for-2020-expressvpn-surfshark-nordvpn-and-more/) to make a bunch of throwaway eBay accounts and stockpile their logins in a spreadsheet or something haha... IDK... or maybe everyone in the bid history is safe as long as the upper-most bid is fake? I don't entirely know how this dark underbelly criminal enterprise works, I'm just here to get the word out. So very shocking, all of this.

Again, do NOT do this. Scalpers are providing a *valuable service* to the PC gaming community when they pay $5 for bot scripts that snap up entire shipments of hardware from etailers and then automatically create auctions on other websites, pulling a 10x turnaround before the hardware even hits the first warehouse's shelves. It would be wrong to use bot scripts to deprive them of their right to trade graphics cards - **just put yourselves in their shoes**. They would *never* use technology maliciously to deprive *you* of a graphics card trade, would they? No. Never.

Also - do not [create](https://www.fullstackpython.com/bots.html), [share](https://github.com/), and use bot scripts or other software tools designed to derail these auctions with said throwaway eBay accounts (fully automated, or machine-assisted via URL scraping, doesn't matter). It's simply a very immoral and reprehensible thing to do. This should go without saying, but it's also very wrong to create and share public anti-scalper Telegram channels and Discord servers with the sole purpose of sharing eBay listings with each other for you, or your bid-bombing bots, to... well... bid-bomb. Very bad - do not do.

Again - Please do not do any of these things. They will only get the account, and its hundreds (possibly thousands, if you bot) of dirty bids, banned from eBay (unless, again, the account merely drove up the bid price but wasn't the winner of the auction - they'd just be able to claim ""Oh, I bought something else because I didn't win. If only you had told me 5 minutes sooner. Darn!"").

Just imagining the *distraught and panicked* look on this poor scalper's face when they're forced to stay up late into the night doing *real, actual work*, cancelling bids for hours on end as new stock trickles back onto the shelf should be enough to motivate you to not do it. They'd miss out on so many interactions with their loving friends and family that definitely exist. It just breaks my heart! What kind of *awful* person would use bot software to turn the tides of online sales in their own favor and deprive PC users of hardware? So very sad... to think, with each passing week, the shelf price falls further and further below what the scalpers paid on launch day... sometimes to the point that they might begin to wonder if their main source of income being ""owning someone else's graphics cards"" was a smart long-term idea...

So, anyways... thanks for reading.","The moderators of /r/AMD do NOT condone locating scalper auctions, leaving dozens of absurd bids, so as to repeatedly derail a scalper's opportunity to make a sale and ultimately de-incentivize PC hardware scalping."

Amd,"I've been unable to find much information about this setting. This is the toggle found under the 'Graphics' tab of the Radeon Settings; not the one found under the 'Display' tab.

On my monitor, an LG 34GN850 (supposedly a 10bit panel), I notice a few things after enabling the setting. It definitely interferes with Freesync. I don't see the refresh rate change with framerate; Freesync is still being detected as on though. 

However, I'm unable to see any tearing....anywhere. Vysnc on or off, doesn't matter, no tearing. Does it enable and enforce some kind of buffering at the driver level? 

I want to say that I notice a bit more color depth but it's hard to say. Something does seem better or at the very least different but it could just be in my head. I feel like motion seems a bit clearer but 'jumpy'. The best way I can find to describe it is that it feels like looking at a really fast flip-book but when disabled Freesync adds blur between frames and thus seems smoother but a tad bid muddier.

When comparing to it off, motion does seem blurrier. Regardless of whether Freesync is on or off in the driver or the monitor. Likewise with Vsync. And as expected, tearing comes back with all three settings off.

I've had a Ryzen 5 2600x in my system for a while now with the stock Wraith Spire cooler.

I recently bought a high airflow case and noticed the fan was whining even at idle.

Just yesterday I decided to check the temps and fan speeds with HWInfo and while the temperature was 40c at idle, the fan was at ~2400 rpm.

I rebooted into the (latest) BIOS of my MSI B450 Pro Carbon AC (non MAX) and saw the default configuration began at 55% fan speed.

More specifically, it was set as 55% speed up to 35c,  70% speed above 50c and 100% fan speed over 60c.

That's absurdly high for no reason at all.
I immediately changed it to:

 20% @ 40c

45% @ 50c

65% @ 60c

100% @ 75c

Booted into windows and lo and behold it's MUCH quieter now at idle and light use.

After 3 hours of gaming it topped at 74c which I find perfectly reasonable for everyday use.

Just thought I'd share for anyone using the stock cooler, check your fan curves in the BIOS because my system was way too loud for no reason.",High CPU fan speed on B450 Pro Carbon

Today  I wanted to do some benchmarks with Port Royal and Cinebench, but  before I checked the stats of my hwmonitor software, and what I found  was my CPU CCD1 running arround 60 degrees in idle. Min/Max/Avg is all  arround 60-61, which is insanly high, but my CCD2 runs between 38 and 40  degrees. Now I dont want to destroy anything and working/writing from  my old PC again.

* Kraken Z73 w/ QL120 pegged at 100%

Originally, I went into the BIOS, turned on PBO and just went about my business. Recently, an NZXT cam update came out allowing me to monitor Zen 3 temps on my AIO LCD, and I noticed I was hitting high 80s while gaming. This seemed quite high, so I went and turned off ""Core Performance Boost"" as well as PBO in the bios and my gaming loads went to rarely breaking 60C.

Then I get the latest beta of MSI afterburner finally allowing me to monitor CPU while gaming. So I do some gaming and I realize that the CPU is pegged at 3400 mhz, so no boosting at all. I went and turned ""Core Performance Boost"" back to Auto, and now I'm boosting up to 4.9 ghz, but my temps are hitting 80C at times. It's worth noting that Ryzen master always reports a temperature that's anywhere from 0-9C lower than the temps reported by Afterburner and NZXT Cam. Pretty sure this is package vs core temp.

Should a 5950X with stock boosting be hitting 80C on a 360 AIO with fans (I know QL120 are crappy for rads) pegged at max? A few of my fellow 5950X owners are saying they have PBO turned on and are in the 60s while gaming?!",What are normal 5950X temps?

* TGP of 186 to 211 watts;

Also, let's not forget about the 54% performance-per-watt promised by AMD over RDNA1.  


Overall these figures look like substantial cut-downs if compared to the RX 6800, particularly when it comes to CUs, memory bus and Infinity Cache. Now the RX 6800 is believed by many not to be a direct competitor against the RTX 3070, as it's price and performance are almost one-tier above (likely comparable to an eventual 3070 ""Super""). Therefore some (myself included) believe the 6700XT to be the actual answer against the 3070. But these specs seem much lower than what they would need to be to compete against the 3070 (which is on average 10-13% slower than the 6800).

Nvidia advantage is obviously RT and it seems like higher framer rate at 4k...

Is there any reason why I should keep ref 6800 XT ? 
Giving the same price (3080 Is even 20 dollars cheaper in my case...)
Better RT performance
Better 4k average frame rate

I run a 1080Ti for my GPU while gaming at 4K, and I didn't realize how much my 3770k was bottlenecking my GPU. Sounds kind of funny to hear in retrospect but I think I was losing about 10-20% fps. Anyway, I did notice that running benchmarks like CB R20 and Prime95 would toast the 5800X up to 83C even on my NH-D15S with its A15 and 4x A12x25s blowing full blast.

However the temperature is only a problem for multithreaded applications. Gaming is still mostly single threaded and even with EcoMode turned on, there was very little degredation to CB20 single thread and gaming fps (SoTTR and Witcher3, mainly GPU bound in 4K anyway).

So here's my workaround to the high temperatures:

* Enable ECO mode 65W
* \+200 AutoOC
* Dynamic undervolt (I have mine set to -0.1V)

I'm sure curve optimizer would help out even more but right now the F11i bios from gigabyte is very buggy and I cannot re-enter the bios once I flash it. With these settings, HWInfo would report max temperature of 60C while gaming and fans are silent. While multithreaded benchmarks do suffer, in practice, I can still have multiple browser tabs, discord, telegram, youtube, etc. while gaming and cannot perceive any degradation. 

Overall I am very happy with this setup now that I have tweaked it to my liking. I can still get the maximum frames from my GPU while the system is quiet and drawing minimal power. I also undervolt my GPU and still get 50-60+ fps in 4K games. Hope my experience will help you guys on the fence or hesitant about getting a 5800X.",5800X temperature workaround for gaming

I ordered a Ryzen 7 2700X because the price is great, but now I'm wondering if I should have gone with a different Ryzen? I don't know a whole lot about building computers so I'd love some advice. Thanks!",Best Ryzen CPU for gaming
Amd,There should be some means of denying warranty for products purchased from scalpers to de-incentivize the behavior. Maybe time gate it so that any warranty claim for a product that shipped from the manufacturer for 3 months after launch would require the original credit card number used to purchase(for the life of the warranty)? Maybe even have a launch SKU thats different then a post launch sku. This whole situation is bananas and if additional measures are not used to penalize purchased scalped products then sadly the current state we are in will happen again.,Preventing scalpers in the future
Amd,"I am using NZXT X73 to cool my new 5800X. It goes around 45C at low load, which is fine. But when I open some software (not games), the temp immediately goes to around 70C and goes back to 45C within several seconds. But when the temp rapidly increases, the cooling fans goes to high speed. This is quite annoying.

Any idea on how to solve this?

I am using ASUS TUF gaming X570-plus with the newest bios.",5800X unstable temp
Amd,"I was able to snag a 5800x today at Denver Microcenter!  They got about 130 in today (as well as 6 3090's and just over 50 3080's for GPUs).  As someone who has tried for too long using hotstock, telegram, etc... I would highly recommend just dealing with the lines in person.","To those trying to by a 5000 series processor, the lines are WORTH IT"
Amd,"I really really wanted to do an all AMD system, but after the last 10 days it became obvious to me that:

1. You have to be extremely lucky to get on retail
2. The AMD AIB pricing is ludicrous
3. It seems that the cards are going to rise in price

As a result, I decided that whichever I get first, be it a 3080 or a 6800Xt would be the card I get. If I hold out for AMD, whose launch also seems to be on tissue paper it could take me 6 months.

Funny thing is that I actually bought an EVGA FTW3 three weeks ago, but solid it because of all the horrible experiences people are having, and at the time I believed AMD and thought it would not be impossible to get a video card. Sold it at list price so I did not scalp. The guy who bought it (around 1 min after listing) was so happy and excited. It was cool. I don't regret selling it.

So I started scouring CL. I am in San Diego and there was a solid amount of ads. Some were from predatory scalpers, but those were easy to weed out. Most are well below the EBAY scalping level which I would never do but still really high. It seems a lot of people are getting preorders and EVGA queue orders in and had already found the card some other way. And several would negotiate. It's not a bad way to go with some effort but definitely some risk.

In the end I paid $970.

Seems expensive, but I noticed that BH has it at $799 but out of stock. And AMD has raised the price in their store to $849.

When I saw this it dawned on me that we might be entering another phase where all the GPUs sell for more than MSRP or original MSRP, and availability will remain ultra scarce. So my premium really wasn't all that much around $60-$70 considering tax.

Also the card is awesome. It is really really fast compared to my 1070 TI even with my i5-8400 processor (still waiting for some parts on my 5600X new PC though I have the processor. It is also DEAD silent even at load, and never got about 59 degrees in Time Spy (17556 graphics score so pretty decent)

I am just glad for it to be over. I wanted to support AMD but nothing about their launch is any more consumer positive than what what NVIDIA did.

If $849 is the new baseline, then considering tax and shipping I really did not pay much of a premium at all.",I gave up and went ASUS TUF 3080 OC

Amd,"That's zero fucks, for those playing along at home.

**TL;DR:** There is no incentive for AMD and NVIDIA to try and improve customer sentiment right now.

We've talked a lot about Economics 101 on these subreddits over the last several months. Let's pivot and look at customer sentiment for a minute. Usually companies consider positive customer sentiment (which can be measured by things like net promoter score) beneficial to revenue.

But this matters a lot more in some markets than others. For example, having a strong net promoter score matters **a lot** to a high-end restaurant competing with 15 others in a busy city centre. Consistently high Yelp/Zagat/Google reviews are going to ensure the restaurant attracts diners, while a 2.4 out of 5 with comments about poor customer service, flies in the soup and so on will hurt financial viability over time.

AMD and NVIDIA are a duopoly in the PC GPU space. This is better for consumers than a monopoly - see e.g. RTX 2080 Ti price/perf when there was no high-end rival product - but it's still not very competitive.

When supply chain issues (COVID-19) and massive pent-up demand (also COVID-19) result in every GPU the manufacturer can get to market selling out in less than 30 seconds, there is absolutely no incentive for them to pay attention to Reddit and YouTube complaints about anti-consumer behaviours and bait advertising with fake launch MSRPs. The AMD and NVIDIA GPU divisions could have net promoter scores of 2-3 out of 10 and no one at head office would give a single fuck as long as the GPUs keep flying off the shelves.

It's worth noting that at the AIB level there is still an incentive to provide good customer service. I can count at least 12 AIB manufacturers just based on brands I'm aware of, and competition in that space is pretty fierce. This is why you see companies like EVGA try to differentiate themselves with pro-consumer warranty/return policies for example.

As a consumer, there is nothing you can do about AMD and NVIDIA's anti-consumer practices and pricing except to not buy their products. Because if 6800XTs keep flying off the shelves at 25% mark-ups over MSRP and there isn't a single 3070 or 3080 to be found anywhere, that's sending the GPU duopoly strong signals that they should keep doing what they're doing.",Reality check: AMD and NVIDIA give exactly as many fucks about Reddit's unhappiness at GPU pricing as the number of 6800XTs and RTX 3080s currently in stock...

Also, I dont care about RGB.",RAM for Ryzen 5000 series
Amd,"Hello everyone,

yes, i know, AMD sad, that Ryzen 3000 would not be compatible with the Curve Optimizer. But to be completly honest, i doubt that.

It pains me to say this, but AMD has lied more and more the last few years. For example, the Cut for 300 series Boards, because ""Bios Chip too small"", PCIe4.0 on 300 and 400 series Boards, and the ""new manufacturing process from the 3000 XT series, which has fundamental other transistors than the normal 3000 CPUs"", which we also know, was a lie.

So, back to the point, there is literally no reason, that the curve optimizer would not work, when the only thing different between 3000 and 5000 chips is the Chiplet architecture, even the IO Die is exactly the same.",Ryzen 3000 with Curve Optimizer
Amd,"The 6800 XT and 3080 are more or less equal at 1080p/1440p, but the 3080 pulls ahead at 4K. If I were to play games at 4k upscaled from 1080p, or at 5k from 1440p, using DSR or VSR (4x multiplier), would the 3080's 4k advantage similarly translate into better DSR performance?  Would the same apply to performance when using in-game resolution scaling sliders like in Battlefield 5?",Is a GPU's 4K performance indicative of its DSR/VSR and resolution scaling performance?

*Note: The following information is compiled from successful experiences from the [pcbuildhelper community](https://discord.gg/yUAk993)*

## How to be successful in buying a [insert cpu/gpu]

## Part 1:

Know exactly what you’re looking for and stick to it. I know it’s frustrating not being able to get ANY card/cpu. But make sure you’re actually willing to settle for that non FE card or 5800X, or else you’ll end up with buyers remorse and go through the hassle of trying to trade it (no ones going to really be trading down right now).

## Part 2:

Pick the stores you want or are willing to buy from, and make sure you know their practices. There are some stores out there that will take preorders for days and not even have any indication when they will get any stock

*Note: I’m in the US and this list is mainly for this region.*

**Stores to follow**

* [https://bestbuy.com](https://bestbuy.com) \- the rarest( \~once a week) to drop of them all, but when they drop they drop big. And IMO their RNG button queue is the best anti bot (almost anti-human) system.
* [https://amazon.com](https://amazon.com) \- they like to do pre-orders, and even though the dates seem far, they will always get pushed up and orders will come to those “first in line”
* [https://newegg.com](https://newegg.com) \- has been the best with massive drops, albeit mostly bundles. But you can always return/sell/trade the bundled item.

For newegg, use apple pay and the app, it's the fastest

For amazon, setup the one click option in your account settings

**Stores with some luck**

* [https://adorama.com](https://adorama.com)
* [https://provantage.com](https://provantage.com)
* [https://walmart.com](https://walmart.com) (surprisingly)

**Stores to avoid (usually)**

These are stores that have pre-orders that don’t have much transparency in regards to when fulfillment will actually happen (I’ve been waiting for a camera from BH for over 3 months..)

* [https://bhphotovideo.com](https://bhphotovideo.com])
* [https://shopblt.com](https://shopblt.com])

**Local Shops**

These tend to be in-person only so you have better chances since there are no bots, but depending on your location these may not exist

* microcenter
* central computers

## Part 3:

We all have lives to live and F5ing in front of our screen is not always the best option. There are several ways to get notifications, with some being more hands off than others

*Disclaimer: I built pcbuildhelper.com as a personal project, and have opened it to the world as a free service/site/discord alert bot*

_Note: there are other discords that are behind a paywall.. **DO NOT PAY OR SUPPORT ANY** a collection of the free servers are just as good if not better, and the paid ones tend to include scalpers._

**Streams**

I would suggest streams but tbh the linking system and the amount of data used is not ideal. You’re better off in a discord.

**Distill**

It's simply a chrome refresh extension with some change rules. One of the better local solutions IMO if you're looking for specific products and have the data and time.

*Note: It can eat a lot of data, and depending on the sites you're looking at you can get IP banned*

There’s a lot of guides out there such as [https://hackintosher.com/blog/get-hands-coffee-lake-cpu/](https://hackintosher.com/blog/get-hands-coffee-lake-cpu/)

You can just google “how to use distill to get XYZ”.

So there’s no need for me to regurgitate that information.

**Running (or even making) your own tracker**

If you’re really inclined you can use various open source projects to either use out of the box or as a basis for your own tracker

Join their respective discords if you’re looking to go down this route for help!

## Final thoughts

Again I know how frustrating it can be in today's scalper/botting world. Stores/brands should ideally be the ones fixing this (shout out to EVGA for having a nice queue list, and Bestbuy for their queue button), but this is the best I can think of to help combat it in our own way. Let's hope more stock comes in, and let's get some dubs.

Amd,"Hi,

Many of us stopped using DDU because AMD has implemented this feature in the driver installer + the option to restore previously saved settings. This saves a lot of time and I've personally never used DDU anymore since the feature exists without issues. 

Now, the AMD driver does work as intended but by restoring previous settings, the game profiles get restored aswell. But this can cause driver instability in certain games when you try to open the AMD sidepanel or when you try to enter the driver settings while a game is launched.

I don't know why but it seems that the game profile contains more info than what is visible to the user and certain settings, originally created for your old AMD GPU cause a misconfiguration for a new Radeon 6800.

The fix is easy. If you notice that the driver crashes in a certain game when you want to enter the driver settings, or you notice instability in general, simply delete that game profile, click on ""refresh"" so that the driver creates a new one, and you can reconfigure your preferences in the new game profile. Even when you configure the exact same game profile settings, the driver will no longer crash when you try to open it while gaming.

This does show that using DDU or not using ""Restore previous settings"" is still the best way to make sure everything is 100% stable. Because if this happened with this launch, you can be fairly sure that this happened before. And I understand 100% that people that upgrade from AMD to AMD want to restore their previous settings in order to avoid regonfiguring everything.","New Radeon 6800/6800XT upgraders, recreate your game profiles!"

Amd,"My 5600X came in the mail earlier this week and immediately I noticed my benchmarks aren't what they should be. My all-core CBR20 score was barely above my stock 3600, and even with highly tuned PBO I'm still below 4000. All-core boost only reached base clock at stock, just below 4ghz with PBO. Single core scores are better but still disappointing.

I remembered that Optimum Tech had similar issues, detailed in this video [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xFaCVOFST0). It's worth noting that both my and his issues are on X570 Mini ITX boards (from two different manufacturers), but after some searching it seems like a fair number of people are having the same issue on both B550 and X570 boards of all form factors. Hard to tell what the issue is exactly, but hopefully upcoming BIOS updates will fix the issue.

If you're looking to buy a Ryzen 5000 series processor, it may be worth searching to see if other people with your motherboard are having any such issues. There's no way of knowing if/when BIOS updates will fix the problem but hopefully they will soon. I have hope that PBO2 will at least help mitigate the issue next month.

Amd,"There is a lot going on...
In my humble opinion the 3000 and 5000 series are not really good in price performance.
I'm currently using a 115€ Ryzen 5 1600AF which is probably still wort 100€-110€.

Heres why:
There are no better alternatives.

The Ryzen 5 2600(X) is on pair with it.

The Ryzen 5 3600 is like 8% faster, but often costs 50€ more, which is a really bad upgrade in perfomance for the money (this would be okay for high end, but in mid range it should be way more linear).

The Ryzen 5 3500X is 150€ too, no alternative there I guess?

I bought myself a b550 Mainboard and wanted to upgrade my ""old"" 1600AF.
Wanted to sell it for 100-110€(i know this is the price I bought it for, but there's no better alternative out there and people still sell for this price).

Am I overseeing some options... ?
Why is it so ""broken""?
A Ryzen 5 5600X with 20% more perfomance than a 5 3600X cost 2x as much? 20% more perfomance for 200% more money?

The used market seems to have high demand but low offer? Do you agree? 
Where does this come from? 

Would you upgrade in my situation, and to which CPU?

**Looks:**

Looks and feels like a premium product. Best reference design ever from AMG if you ask me.

**Noise:**

Most silent AMD card i've had in years. My Vega 56 sounded like a plane lifting off when I overclocked it to Vega 64 performance. My radeon VII also required a custom fan profile to keep clocks high but at much lower noiselevels and this card is superquite compared to those two. I did end up using a custom fan profile on the 6800, not because it was needed but just because I felt like 97°C hotspot temperature was a bit to high for my liking ( sidepanel case was open ) I have to keep in mind that during summertime my ambient room temperatur is about 1-2°C higher. Combine that with a little dust and you can easely expect higher GPU temperatures in the summer.

**Undervolt/overclock:**

Undervolting and overclocking this card is easy. It's really hard to ""crash"" the card. Every time it becomes unstable you just notice lower performance, but I wasn't able to crash the card at all. At some point the driver did crash but instantly rebooted and kept on working just fine. The reviewers that overclocked the card at 100% fanspeed are simply \*\*\*\*\*\* in the head. Nobody will actually want the fans to spin that loud unless your PC is in another room.

\- Core: 2400Mhz @ 880mv ( will result in clocks between 2230-2340 while gaming )

\- Memory: 2150Mhz + ""Fast"" memory timings preset ( will result in 2138-2140mhz while gaming )

\- Powerlimit: 15%

\- Fan profile: 25% - 50% - 60% - 65% - 75%  ( max )

These settings resulted in a furmark increase from 13635 points to 15577 points on 1080p:[https://gpuscore.top/furmark/show.php?id=212676](https://gpuscore.top/furmark/show.php?id=212676)

That's means in theory, in the best possible scenario I would have 14% performance gain with this overclock. In reality I'll be lucky to get half of that in games offcourse.

**Power &amp; temperature:**

Despite the undervolt, the increased powerlimit combined with the core and memory overclock did result in an uplift from 204WATT to 235WATT during furmark benchmarking.

With my custom settings, the temperature during full load didn't increase at all and remained at 66°C but the hotspot temperature did increase from 89° to 93°. For those of you who wonder why the stock hotspot temperature was that high, well, I always stresstest the card for 20min with my sidepanel open before I run the benchmark so that the card is nice and warm when I start it. Benchmarks in perfect conditions are useless anyway.

\---

That was it really. Summary. It's faster, more silent, cooler, less power consuming than my Radeon VII. And as a Battlefield 1 gamers, I couldn't be happyer since this card is a beast in frostbite engine. I will update this thread if needed if I notice that for some reasons the overclock settings turn out to be unstable in certain games. I play BF1, No Mans's sky, &amp; Microsoft Flight sim. So I should notice something in the next week.

Amd,"Let me start this by saying, I'm not an early adopter, I'm no hardcore F5'er and I'm not that mad about the ""launch"" just... surprised? Oh and this is in no way intended as a rant, still a happy AMD customer just a bit disappointed about the communication beforehand.

I was actually expecting stock of NV cards be low and the demand to be crazy high, because of all the people that want to upgrade their PC for Cyberpunk and *dem traced rays yo*, also around Christmas everyone goes crazy and feels the need to upgrade their PC for some reason. I planned ahead and upgraded everything else over the course of this year, buying used parts way under MSRP and saving a lot of money I wanted to spend on a big GPU (usually my max is around \~400).

&amp;#x200B;

So expecting a flop, I was surprised seeing AMD telling people that they shouldn't worry about supply at release. Maybe they went a similar route as with CPUs and the chiplets, making production yields more effective or something.  I even gave them the benefit of the doubt, that demand at the Reference Launch was way higher than they anticipated because of the whole NV situation and being interested in AIBs way more I just waited it out. Hearing how the reference cards sort of got restocked everyday I was looking forward to yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday put the nail in the coffin for me of having any hope of finding a new GPU this year so I'll happily hold onto my used RX480 (which I got for free actually) and spend my money on a new Headphone + Mic setup, a new Phone and maybe even a notebook. It's not worth my time getting my hopes up just to be disappointed again so I won't even try to get one for the rest of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closing this off, AMD... please. Next time just be brutally honest and say that you don't have enough supply and that it's really hard right now to get production up and running like it used to before 2020.  People will take you way more serious and actually be understanding of something like this. I like shiny new tech like everyone else but I actually value honesty and communication **a lot more.** I just don't understand why companies can't talk to their customers like normal people anymore.

Just my **0,02€** (exc. taxes)

Hope everyone of you fine people has a nice day! :)

Amd,"There's a lot of these reflection posts going on here right now—that kind of mood I guess.

AMD has taken the performance crown in CPUs this year and they're an arm's reach from NVIDIA's performance crown in GPUs.

The value crown is now gathering dust on the floor.

For 3 generations Zen couldn't surpass Intel in performance, but it increasingly offered astounding value propositions, culminating in Zen2. What was so delightful about Zen2 was the value of the chips. People could point to the performance gap all they wanted, but in nearly every situation, other than squeezing out the most FPS in games, Zen2 was probably more worth your money, and you wouldn't go broke. The 3600 isn't legendary because it's the best. It's because it was the best value.

We're all impressed with Zen3 performance. But I don't give a damn that they're faster than Intel. Not only did they increase prices by $50 across the board, they deliberately withheld their better value offerings. During Zen2 it was so common for people to recommend not buying the X variety of 3600, for example - it wasn't worth the price bump. With Zen3, AMD is avoiding this altogether. It makes great business sense. The value crown is still gathering dust on the floor.

When the 5000 series of video cards was released and NVIDIA countered with the Supers, AMD slashed prices of their brand new cards even further. They insisted on making the GPU space competitive in pricing. They didn't even bother with a 5800 series—they focused on getting decent 1440p cards that were often a lot more affordable than NVIDIA's offerings.

With the 6000, they've caught up in the high end. Benchmarks fluctuate, but nobody denies AMD is competitive with all NVIDIA's cards. Good on them—but again, I don't give a damn. I still have to pay more than a next generation console to get their weakest of 3 cards so far. And that's if I can ever find a reference card, because as we're now learning, AIB boards are $100 higher price or more. How much are frames worth? The value crown is still gathering dust on the floor.

I'm tempted by next-gen goodness, but thank god for these supply issues—they're giving me an opportunity for sober assessment. I miss the value king. I think I'll wait patiently for their return.

*Edit:* Yes I get that Zen2 is still available and still a budget option. But A) 'value' is not the same as 'budget' and B) Zen2 offered *value* on day one.",Demise of the value king

Amd,"ASRock Rack has unveiled its latest small form factor motherboard designed for AMD's EYPC processors, the ROMED4ID-2T. It is based on a new proprietary form factor similar to Mini-ITX, affectionally colloquialized as 'Deep' Mini-ITX, which is slightly larger than standard mini-ITX. The board supports for EPYC Rome 7002 processors up to 64 cores.

Being able to amalgamate up to 64 cores with a mini-ITX motherboard isn't a small feat; the ROMED4ID-2T does it for users looking to build a server with a small overall footprint. This model opts for a new wider proprietary design, the 'deep mini-ITX' form factor with dimensions of 6.7 x 8.2 inches, rather than 6.7-inch square for regular mini-ITX.

The main obvious limitation with such a small motherboard size and a large socket is that not all of the features of the processor is made available - there are some sacrifices to put it all in. That starts with the memory support, with this model only having four memory slots, and therefore four memory channels, rather than the standard eight channels that EPYC Rome can provide. The other is PCIe 4.0 support - there is one PCIe 4.0 x16 full length slot, and six Slimline PCIe 4.0 x8 ports, but that is still far fewer than the 128 lanes this CPU can provide. 

For storage devices, other than the single M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 slot, there is plenty to accommodate multiple drives, despite the size limitations, with up to sixteen SATA ports support from two of the Slimline ports, which ASRock states can be configured within the BIOS. This also includes support for bulk U.2 storage, with two Slimline ports operating at PCIe 4.0 x8 or eight SATA ports, and the other four Slimline simply listed as being PCIe 4.0 x8 only.

Being primarily marketed as a server-focused model, it includes many of the usual suspects regarding internal headers, including one for IPMB, PMBus, and a 13-pin LPC TPM header. There are also three 4-pin fan headers, each with its own fan fail LED.

Regarding connectivity, the ASRock Rack ROMED4ID-2T includes an Intel X550-AT2 10 Gb controller, which adds two 10 GbE ports on the rear panel, as well as a dedicated Realtek RTL8211E Ethernet port for the board's IPMI. A single DB15 D-Sub video output is present for users looking to access the system physically over the IPMI, with a UID LED button and a pair of USB 3.2 G1 Type-A ports.

At present, ASRock hasn't given any information regarding pricing or availability, but we expect to hear something shortly.",AMD EPYC Rome in (Deep) Mini-ITX? ASRock Rack's New ROMED4ID-2T

Hey guys,

I got lucky and managed to buy a RX6800 on launch. Unfortunately shortly after, I saw the real world benchmarks and the disappointing RT performance.

At the same time a buddy of mine sent me a great deal on a pre-built system including a RTX3080 and a 5600x, with both being in stock so I decided to order than instead.

As AMD does not allow you to cancel your order, they shipped the card and it arrived yesterday.

I've seen a lot of people being frustrated at missing out on one so I thought I'd offer it here first before it goes back to AMD and then most likely to a scalper.

I'd be happy to pass it on for the exact price I paid for it + whatever shipping method you want. I paid €596.38 including shipping.

For simplicity and also buyer protection, this is only for people in the EU. Payment ideally through PayPal as it is the safest option (I think?) Or if you live in Belgium you can come pick it up too.

Let me know of any proof you would like me to post.

Edit: As someone rightfully asked for proof, here it is. I'm not sure about what data I can give out about my order without someone misusing it so let me know if more proof is required

Amd,"I NEVER thought AMD could do worse than Nvidia on their GPU launch... but they have on several fronts which is mind boggling.

1. They don't have stock AND they bragged about having stock.

This would not be a major issue of comparison if they simply didn't have stock. That would be unfortunate and a missed opportunity, but it would be consistent with Nvidia/pandemic/huge demand. However Frank Azor has been out there saying there WON'T be stock issues... and now they have WORSE stock issues than Nvidia. Crazy.

2) They lifted review embargo at launch time, hiding bad RT performance and the general performance of the cards. Just anti-consumer and should be called out.

3) The AIBs didn't give pricing to reviewers on the third party cards. Now that we see the prices are almost all $800+, it's obvious why. Every one of these reviewers if they knew the price was going to be $800 would have said for this price you should buy Nvidia.

It's well beyond AMD not having stock that makes this terrible, it's the anti-consumer practices that they've engaged in. They deserve all the heat they're getting today and will get over the next several weeks/months.

Amd,"On the Radeon RX6800 you can configure a ""Max frequency"" or overclock but also a ""Min frequency"". If you cap your framerate to stay within the freesync range of your monitor, you will still have framedrops here in there.

For example:

You cap your framerate at 142fps to stay within 30-144hz range of your monitor. And you know your GPU can handle it because without the cap it goes to 180+fps minimum. But still you notice framedrops when capped to 120-130fps.

This is because by limiting the framerate, your GPU is no longer operating at 99-100% load and it will downclock. Once it's downclocked it's harder for the GPU to handle certain spikes in workload. 

But, if you increase your minimum frequency at 100Mhz lower then maximum frequency, you will notice that GPU usage will increase again and that the frequency is constantly between the minimum and maximum frequency. This will avoid any framedrops you might have while capping your framerate on stock GPU settings or OC settings.

This might be commen knowledge by many, but I notice on our community discord that it's a common mistake to just cap the framerate and expect the GPU to stay at that framerate 100% of the time.","Make sure to increase your ""Min frequency"" to ""Max frequency"" -100 for stable framecap on Radeon RX6800"

Amd,"First off, let me start by saying that I have been a long time AMD fan simply because they allowed a cheaper entry to computing, right from the days of the **AMD K6 233** which was significantly cheaper than an Intel platform for a similar performance, to the **Athlon 64 3000+** which saw AMD actually take a lead, to the absolute bang for buck **Ryzen 7 1700** which is my current daily driver.

**AMD**, to me was a **tech ENABLER** because it allowed people without deep pockets to have access to computing.

AMD (ATI) GPU's are on a whole different story arc though, in my country. I remember the **ATI 9500/9700** launched around the time I was ready to upgrade from the Riva TnT2 and get a real GPU, but the **GeForce4Ti 4200** was just waay **better priced** here.

I remember being super excited for the SPIDER platform which was supposed to be an ALL AMD system, right after you acquired ATI, but it was priced insanely high here because of what we as a community now call the ""**Gamer Tax**"" which **scalping retailers** and distributors charge for AMD GPU's and are **enabled by you**.

That glorious shitshow of AMD mollycoddling their India distributes at the cost of the brand image and presence in India has now culminated to what is the last straw for me, the 6800xt pricing. I really want to understand what your marketing/pricing team was smoking when they came up with the current suggested retail pricing structure, because it sure as hell wasn't regular pot.

Nvidia is selling the **3070FE** is available here at **44.5k INR** inclusive of taxes ( 499 USD converted to INR + 18% taxes ). And you priced the **6800** at 46k INR ( 580 USD + 120 USD pot money? ) EXCLUSIVE of taxes, so **54.5k INR** total when you add the 18% taxes. Source : [https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1329054274702209027](https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1329054274702209027)

With limited stocks for the 3070FE and AIB partners selling at around 53-55k price point that may still sell some units since its the better performer, personally I'd just hold out for the Nvidia FE.

But the **6800XT** oh my, you really did a number here, didn't ya. Officially priced at 65k INR ( 650 USD + 230 USD Meth money??? ) EXCLUSIVE of taxes, so **77k INR** total when you add the 18% taxes. Source : [https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1331606098659467265](https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1331606098659467265)

For reference, the **3080FE** is listed by Nvidia at **62k INR** inclusive of taxes ( 699 USD converted to INR + 18% taxes ). Granted that the 3080FE is hard to get, but hard to get is still better than the MIA 6800XT. And how come a price **increase of $70** from the 6800 to 6800XT translates to an **increase of $110** in your official pricing???

AIB 3080s are available right now for a lower price than what your pricing for the 6800XT is, and that is a GPU better at almost EVERYTHING than the 6800XT with several additional features, which is why AMD officially chose to price lower to compete internationally. If this is your India pricing strategy, who is coming up with this? Are people actually getting paid to do this job? Baboons with a typewriter would have a higher chance of not f\*\*\*ing up India pricing for GPUs for AMD at this point.

On a side note, I had preordered the 5950x on the day of launch (AMD CPU pricing is a lot saner in India thankfully), your India Retail partner has stated, in written mail, that AMD is not honoring the stock commitment that they had made to them so the order will be delayed indefinitely. Well played on that front as well.

However, you have to understand that low supply and high demand means high prices. Just because a person is willing to pay an exorbitant amount for an item, that does not give you the rights to intervene or steal. Just imagine yourself as:

- A customer trying too win an auction. He needs a nvidia graphic for his computer ASAP.  However, he doesn't end up getting any graphic because of fake bids.

- A seller driving 1 hour to meet a craigslist buyer. Wait another 30 minutes for the guy to show up. Turns out he was never interested in buying.

- A seller receiving a charge back from fraudulent buyer and is now at risk the risk of losing $1500.

Amd,"Checking ebay right now... the prices of 5800x are basically converged with MSRP at $449.. many listings ending near or even under the MSRP price +/- 10%. I don't even know if the resellers will let the sales go through at this point because if they bought retail from a newegg or best buy they would be losing money on these sales after ebay commissions.

The 5600x are a bit higher averaging around $50-100 over MSRP but still much more reasonable than double.

I think many of you saw that the retailer Antonline actually had 5800x in-stock and available for nearly 48 hours and many had their orders immediately shipped and confirmed. Keep in mind also that ebay takes a 10% cut of sales and there are potentially additional fees at the paypal or payment processor level that makes 5600x and 5800x basically unprofitable for scalpers now, meaning they will be taken out of the market from direct retailer buys.

This, compounded with the rumored ""additional large shipments"" that retailers will be getting from now until the end of the month should be encouraging for those in the market for one of these chips. If you don't feel super strongly about buying from scalpers (whether from a moral or warranty / returnability perspective), you can basically get any of these two cards with a minimal markup right now on ebay (maybe even cheaper if you have ebay bucks or other coupons saved / stacked).

Unfortunately the 5900x and 5950x are still selling at nearly a 50% premium on ebay so they are still scarce and profitable for the scalpers to bot.

Amd,"So I started researching into this when the screenshots of the chiphell poster were circulating with a 5900X running on an AsRock A320 mobo.  So, it turns out a couple of things happen to be true.  First, AsRock's B450/X470 motherboard line is pretty much a copy pasta of their B350/X370 line.  Second, how AsRock develops it's BIOSes is that they make an X470 BIOS and then they ""downmix"" them to their B450, X370, and B350 boards.

Therefore, it's a reasonable assumption that you can just flash a 400-series BIOS onto their 300-series counterpart.  In fact, there have been several successful examples of this on Techpowerup and Overclock.net forums.  After that, just update to the newest beta BIOS that AsRock just released and then you'll have Vermeer support.  Hopefully you have a CH341A bios flasher lying around in case you have made any errors in judgement up to this point. 

For the initial flash, you need to use flashrom to flash the BIOS instead of the built in utility or flashback.  This is the cleanest way to update the BIOS; the BIOS's built in utility always leaves some code because it's running the flash itself.  Flashrom also bypasses AsRock's authentication that blocks people from flashing a BIOS from the wrong model.  Be sure to backup your initial BIOS because the BIOS contains the serial number, which is helpful for warranty reasons.  If you need to RMA, you'd need to flash back to this BIOS because flashrom wipes everything.  I used the-stilt's modified BIOS for the initial flash.

After that, my motherboard identified itself as the B450 Gaming-itx/AC (with a B350 chipset).  Then it was trivial to update to the newest BIOS using the built in BIOS updating utility on a Ryzen 7 1700.  Because of this, I can also confirm that AsRock/AMD did not remove support for 1st gen Ryzen when they added Vermeer / Ryzen 5000 support, even on a 16MB BIOS.  1st gen Ryzen works fine with the newest BIOSes.

See attached screenshot for verification: https://imgur.com/LgQ9jet  (pay attention to the motherboard / chipset)

If anything, this proves that there is no hardware chipset limitation nor BIOS size limitation on Ryzen 5000 series support on B350/X370 motherboards.  It's very possible, the motherboard manufacturers just need to put in the work.  I can't imagine it's a lot of effort seeing as how simple this flash was.  Certainly in the realm of more experienced hobbyist BIOS modders.  

Anyone else tried this yet?

I was rly surprized. I asked the guys at the shop and they told me that folks are buying AMD CPUS and motherboards like crazy. They have never seen this before. It's like a mass craze for computer parts.

It seems that even ppl who have never owned a desktop PC before are now buying parts to build one and also buy AMD CPUs.

Amd,"As someone who bought a Ryzen 5 5600X CPU (with a B550 board) in anticipation of purchasing an RX 6800 XT to get the whole SAM performance boost out of the box, I just really can't be fucked waiting for the 6000 series to actually be available in Australia. Stock is not being delivered here, and retailers are removing their listings for the RX 6000 series altogether.

So I'm now looking at the 5700 XT for 1440p, and I'm wondering if SAM will be officially supported before maybe halfway through next year, or if I've overbought on an R5 5600X for no reason.",Will Official SAM Support Come to the RX 5000 Series?
Amd,"Hey everyone, so I'm looking for a stand in GPU until prices and stock normalize for either Nvid or Amd GPUs. Ive got the rest of my build ready - Ryzen 7 5800x, X570 Unify. Can anyone recommend a decent stand in GPU? Will be used for 1440p - gaming and everyday computer use.

Amd,"My brother bought rtx 3070 one month ago for 570€ and yesterday 6800xt for 770€. Our biggest retailer is alza.sk and they have all cards listed since day one, but you can buy them only from their employees as they are putting them on bazos.sk and mostly for 100€ above msrp. 

Funny thing is that for example 3070 for 600 620 640 are there for weeks and people are not willing to pay even 100€ above msrp lol. 

They will give you a recipe exactly like if you bought it directly from the shop with normal 3 year warranty. 

One guy was willing to trade his 6800xt for any 3080 model and nobody was interested,so he sold that card to my brother. He was waiting whole week and nobody asked him if he is willing to just sell it instead. 

People here doesn't care about gpu's for more than 300-500€. This week I could buy 5700xt anniversary edition from two guys, both asking 300€ and it took them several days to sell.",In my country its easy to buy 3000/6000 gpu's

Amd,"Hello,

I am building a single PC using a EVGA FTW3 Ultra 3080 and was originally going with an Intel i9-10900, but decided AMD was the way to go. The PC will be a gaming/streaming set up and also be able to do video editing, photo editing, as well as my workstation since I work from home. I’ve read that many people swear by a second PC for streaming quality, but others say you can do a good job with just one solid PC. I know the threadripper is a work station class CPU, but I was wondering if either one or both would be suited for high end gaming/streaming? Let’s say money isn’t an issue here. I wouldn’t mind spending 600 extra bucks if I can assure my PC will do everything I want and more.",Ryzen 5950X vs Threadripper 3960X
Amd,"After examining the firmware of the RX 6800 XT, I've discovered something interesting: The very same GDDR6 memory modules (the same part, revision, and binning!) were used on the RX 5500 XT. This is odd, because the RX 5500 XT is clocked at only 14Gbps, but it's clear the memory is rated for 16Gbps. This is why the RX 5500 XT will clock higher on the memory than the RX 5600 XT/5700/5700 XT. The RX 5500 XT is, in fact, underclocked.

&amp;#x200B;

The RX 5500 XT features less of these GDDR6 chips - four of them, for a total of 8GB with a 128-bit bus, while the RX 6800 XT has eight of them for a total of 16GB with a 256-bit bus. Even the same memory timings are used for both cards!

&amp;#x200B;

The GDDR6 memory modules, for those that are curious, are Samsung K4ZAF325BM-HC16, revision 8, 16Gb capacity (note, gigabits, not gigabytes), and 16Gbps rated speed.

Amd,"I was banking on getting a 6800XT this year and tried pretty hard to snag one but didn't work out. So last week I bought a 5700xt on sale for about $350. I had firends telling me ""oh god no get a 2070/2080 super or a nividia card. While I was previously running a 1060 for a for a few years wanted to go full AMD. (Plus it's just to tie me over till I can grab a 6800xt) 

All in all this past week putting it through it's paces at 1440p 2.5k resolution and ultra gamming it's been a little work horse for $350, runs a little hot but at 76c° keeps room pretty toasty.

Amd,"I encoded the exact same video with the exact same settings in the same program. One on the 4500u 6/6 and the other on 4300g 4/8.

the 4500u held turbo at 3.5ghz, and the 4300g held turbo at 4.1ghz.

I thought they would have been closer in performance.

monitoring with procexp, I noticed that the 4500u always used 20% more cpu than the 4300g.

4500u used 96% while the 4300g used 76% cpu, both set to high priority.

Why isn't the 4300g able to use more cpu power?

 is hyperthreading just not efficient? Feels like I'm leaving cpu power on the table.

Amd,Is it worth to upgrade my 3950x to 5950x? I mainly use my pc for gaming at 4k and coding using VM.,Upgrade from 3950x to 5950x
Amd,"Ordered this last week from Newegg while I'm waiting for the 5950x I back-ordered from B&amp;H.  I love it so far.  The single core bursts up to 4.825 out of the box with a 611 score on Cinebench R20.  

I know the 5600x is a much better value, but man I couldn't be more pleased with the way its running games.  

I really only play older games but here are two examples:

Diablo 3 went from 60-70 fps at 1440P to 200-240FPS at 4K

The Total War Shogun benchmark was at 54FPS at 1080P Now it's at 190FPS.  

This thing pairs very well  with a 3080.   It's much better than the 2500K with an R9 Fury I had before.  :)

Summary:  I would recommend this if you want to game and don't mind spending the extra $150 on two more cores.

Amd,"The end of the year has been incredible for new tech, we have new Ryzen CPUs, Nvidia &amp; AMD GPUs, Xbox’s and PlayStation 5’s. But why have all these new products been so hard to find? Well lets take a deep dive into the 3 big reasons no one can find any of this amazing new tech.

1, Manufacturing: When trying to find these products, so many people are getting mad at Sony, Microsoft, Nvidia &amp; AMD for not making enough of their products. The reality is they are trying to make them as fast as they can and in some cases have been manufacturing them for a large portion of the year before they were released. The problem here lies with the chip manufacturing.

AMD released 5 new Ryzen CPUs &amp; 3 new Radeon GPUs this year, in addition they also supply the CPU &amp; GPU in the new Xbox and PS5 (which are not the same). This means that AMD alone needs 7 different CPUs and 5 different GPUs to be manufactured to meet these demands. Nvidia has released 3 new GPUs and Apple has several new phone and computer chips that just came out too. The thing about all off these releases, is TSMC &amp; Samsung manufacture all of not only these chips but pretty much every other companies chips in the world. And all this demand all at once means production will be slower for everyone as their capacity is limited.

2. Demand: This years demand for new products is higher than ever. With the pandemic causing everyone to stay at home more than ever before, people are looking for things to entertain them. This increased free time in addition to not spending money on going out or even gas like they used to is leading people to buy more than ever before. It's no longer just the handful of people looking to buy the new hotness, and demand for these new items has more the tripled this year. Adding this demand to the manufacturing issues means inventory for everything is currently gone as companies have to now wait for AMD and Nvidia to provide them with more chips to finish off their products. Sony, Microsoft and GPU board partners can have almost fully finished products but until they receive those chips they can’t sell anything.

3. Scalpers: Because of the increased demand, the appeal of trying to profit off of it is also higher than ever. Scalping is at an all time high with people camping websites all day to buy as many of these items as possible so they can resell them at a higher price to people willing to pay more so they don’t have to wait. Bots have made this and increasingly bad situation as they can process a checkout in under a second in most cases. Some of these scalpers are taking so much of the available stock they have more than some retailers ever had such as the case of the single stapler who claims to have acquired over 3500 PS5’s. This makes it just very hard for normal consumers to get a product from a retailer at MSRP before they are sold out.

All This being said, its pretty clear that it is an over all bad situation all around for trying to get any of these new items. The products are being made, and companies want to get them to us as fast as possible. They want to sell them even more than we want to buy them, but with the demand and supply issues as they are it will just take time. Microsoft has stated they do not expect anymore xbox systems until April 2021 and it may be similar for most of these other products.","The reasons you can't find CPUs, GPUs or Consoles"
Amd,"Put in a full pc order (from the website) over 2 weeks ago with a 5800X CPU. I realize its on backorder so I figure I'll wait it out. Last night I check store inventory on the cpus. They have 7 in stock on the shelf including 2 at their southeast Calgary location which I believe they share with the online shipping warehouse. I try calling today to ask if they can put one of the shelf items into my shipment. The online store doesn't receive calls. I call the Calgary store. Nope, their phones are turned off too. I fill out an online contact form asking them to ship one out with my order. They reply and say ""no, we don't ship out shelf items to online orders"".  I was going to also order a 3080 card once they became available. Oh well, cancelled the entire shipment and went with newegg. I know it's not their fault that supply is limited, but if they're perfectly fine charging me on  day zero for the parts, they should be fine with walking up to the storefront, grabbing an unsold item off the shelf and shipping it out with my 2+ week old order.

My question:

I know that I'm not going to have my hands on a 6800XT for maybe 3 months +? At an affordable price ! And I was wondering what video card I could temporally replace and resell afterwards when I can get my hands on these cards :) !

In the range between 200-250€ ! With less bottleneck as possible (yeah I learned that word on reddit, while reading, informing myself, youtube...)

My goal? With the 6800XT 1440p with full fps :) that the games looks beautifull and have perfect performance ! And maybe, playing chill 4k games like horizon zero dawn on the couch :)! 

The replacing card, I would be happy if I can get 60fps on 1440p but if I must downgrade to 1080p it will not bother me that much... Coming from an VERY old PC (maybe less than 720p xD) with an old TV screen...

\[EDIT\] -- I am using a Wraith Spire Cooler at the moment. It's a bit old, so a replacement BeQuiet! Dark Rock Pro is on the way.

Amd,"I built a Crosshair 8 Hero, with a 3400G, and two sticks of G.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 4000 16 GB 13 days ago.

The 3400G would not go over 2800 MHz reliably.  (That includes 5+ hours of bootable MemTest64).  Since I haven't OC'd RAM or CPU for 7 years, I just used the DOCP values of 16 19 19 39, at 1.40 volts.  (I have a 120mm and 80mm fan blowing down on the RAM from the top of the case).  DRAM temps are steady at 32c, with the mobo saying 30c, and the chipset at 50c (the little chipset fan only runs for a bit at boot).

I got my 5900x, and installed it yesterday.  Today, I started ramping up clock rate.  I'm running 1T, GD disabled, and all the other stuff on auto.  I'm still not sure what selecting DOCP does to the CPU, but IF is running 1:1.

I selected small increments of DRAM clock (every two steps - 266 HZ?) and then would run a couple of minutes of MemTest.  I figured I'd immediately get errors after 2800 MHz, like I did with the 3400G, but ended up at 4000 MHz, and Memtest ran for 1.5 hours before I put the clock back to 2800 MHz, and ran an image backup of my system, for when I start doing 'live' OCCT testing in Windows (after an overnight run of MemTest).  I'll probably start at 3600 MHz, so I don't spend a week of overnight runs to see where I get.

Thanks for the silver, kind redditor. Though, Reddit award is also a kind of unnecessary spending (imo).

Be it Nvidia or AMD, new GPU launches in the past few years have always been plagued by initial supply issue. This is why those new cards are often priced much above MSRP initially.

Scalping also does not help the situation because there are plenty of average joes out there who are willing to participate in such vile practice.It is also worth mentioning that the global pandemic is literally causing longer delays along the supply chain.

If you still have a functional high-end last gen GPU in our PC, be grateful. There are plenty of people out there that have planned to upgrade/build a new PC but can't because of worsening financial situation. There are also those in regions where they would never see a proper distribution channel, and therefore getting scalped by their local retailers.

GPU is a luxury item. If you can afford the unreasonable price hike, that's your choice. Otherwise, just be patient because I'm sure that you can live without it for the next few months. Heck, I might argue that we should just wait for 3rd gen Navi to get that ""Zen 2 - like"" feeling.","New GPU is a luxury item that is in high demand now.

So I change to a 5900X. Just got it last night, went to work, came home and put it in.  I used the ""X"" method I saw some recommend for Ryzen due to chiplets. 

I just did 20 minutes of Cinebench multi-threaded. It hit 66c maximum, but was usually at 63c except a random spike. Holy shit. 

Then I did a single threaded run for 20 minutes, it hit 70c right the start, then went to 66c and went between 66-68c range. 

It was boosting to 4,925MHZ single core. All Core OC was hitting like 4.5GHZ. 

I do not have PBO turned on yet, as it was first boot and i was checking stability. 

But wow. It's like...25c cooler than my 8700K...and it has TWICE THE CORES. 25c is NOT nothing. Jesus.","Holy molly, I am impressed by how cool this 5900X runs!"
Amd,There are no aib cards on ebay yet sooooooo.....,I think it was a true paper launch....
Amd,"Hello there,
I own a ASUS ROG Strix Vega 56 OC, and since i bought it i have only had problems with it.
Not regarding the performance, but regarding the temperatures and more specifically the ominous hotspot.
It surpasses 100° almost immediatly after load is applied, and the card starts throttling substantially when it gets to around 105°C.
I have alread opened the card and renewed the thermalpaste 6 TIMES(!!!), and after doing so, the hotspot stays normal for about 2 weeks, but returns to sh*t after daid period of time (i guess with time the thermalpaste retracts?).
This matter has been subject of discussion in this subreddit already but i have got a question:
I recently found out that the gpu die sits 40microns higher than the hbms do, and i saw a video by steve from GN ( https://youtu.be/mYdQNifQ7Q8 watch at 6:10 ) where he tested the heatsink conact with the dies.
The outcome was not good. If you look closely, you can see that the gpu die has good conact, but the hbms have poor to none at all, with the strix.
So I thought:
Would you guys think its possible to lap the gpu die down to the hbm level?",Lapping Vega 56 die?
Amd,"Reading and watching about all the new graphics card launches made me realise that I don't fit with all of you guys and my bubble got burst.

The thing is, everyone with excitement and satisfaction is looking at 1440p and/or 4k performance of the new cards and tech reviewers like Hardware Unboxed are saying in their review videos something in between the lines of ""everyone is gaming on these resoliutions either way"". 

And here I am with (in my opinion) my kinda high end 3600, 5700xt and a 1080p, 144hz freesync monitor build in my little bubble thinking that I got very good hardware for which i paid 200, 400 and 200 EUR (thats 2 minimum monthly wages in my country) and I feel like a peasant while reading the opinions of the elitists. 

But to be honest steam hardware survey shows that 65%+ of users are gaming at 1080p and most likelly are using similiar or even cheaper hardware than me. And I just can't stop thinking that this new generation of hardware is such a dissapointment for an average gamer. You might say that the mid range gpus haven't released yet but as far as I can tell for the same price of my current gpu with this new generation of gpus I will be able to get a new gpu with none or minimal performance gains because everything got more expensive and now we have RTX also which everyone is excited and crazy about but which won't be used by 65% of steam users because the hardware is too expensive and the performance is too bad and after getting to play with higher refresh rate than 60hz even 58fps can be felt and it sucks and there is no way that I and a lot of people will upgrade to a higher gpu tier or will get significant performance increase at the same price and going up a tier to 1440p will be very expensive because monitors cost more than gpus sometimes and I will be loosing high fps if I am not upgrading my gpu too.

TBH I am really not sure where I went with this post but I feel that gaming industry is aiming 2 tiers higher than an average gamer and and seeing this subbredit and tech reviewers eat it all up when companies offer people experimental technologies which inflate all prices sucks and I needed to rant about this.

TL;DR Prices are stupid, average gamer is 2 tiers lower (1080p, not 4k) than this subbredit and tech reviewers are trying to sell to the masses and I needed this rant to feel better.

Amd,"I finally managed to buy a 5900x.

One though decision I have now is between coolers and RAM. There is no low-profile 3600cl16 RAM available (at least not low enough, I can move up the second fan, but then it will not fit into the case even with a lowest 3600cl16 I found) which would allow me to fit the NH-D15 into my case (meshify c) with two fans. The vengeance lpx 3600cl18 would fit nicely though.

I read that the NH-D15 with only one fan or the NH-D15s runs only about 1-3 hotter. On the other hand, cl18 vs cl16 will at best make a perfomance difference of 2%, probably even lower than that. Both perfomance and temperature difference seem pretty negligible.

What would you choose? Anyone here using the NH-D15s with a 5900x?",5900x: NH-D15s + 3600cl16 or NH-D15 + 3600cl18?

Amd,"Where to begin. I have been trying to get my hands on a 5900x or 5950x since launch, still no luck. Money is not a problem, but because of principle I have not bought the CPU from scalpers. The whole time I have been pissed at those bastards, but ultimately little to nothing is being done to stop them. Scalpers are simply taking advantage of the lack of measures in place to validate a human vs bot purchase.

My anger is now redirected at retailers and AMD. Why? Initially I thought, if I was the owner of Newegg, or any retailer, my end goal is a sale. I put something on the market and someone buys it, plain and simple, regardless of who is making the purchase. But after some thought I find myself more pissed at retailers. If scalpers were removed from the equation these processors, and GPUs,  would still sell out completely. With that said, if you are the owner of Newegg, wouldn't you want your sale to go to your PC building buyers to keep them happy instead of scalpers? The sale will still happen, it is a matter of who you want to keep satisfied with the transaction.

Sorry about the rant, I am just extremely disappointed and can't believe more is not being done. Whether Ryzen was a paper launch, or Big Navi, at the end of the day retailers have treated us like second class citizens. I think we need to rally against them to do something about the scalpers.

Amd,"I've tried this both on a Vega 56 and now a RX 6800 (yes, I was one of the very few that actually got one).

When attempting to stream at 4k to the pi 4 (which must use HEVC at this resolution for a non-laggy experience), the stream works, but every half-second or so the screen becomes blurry briefly. It then clears up for a another half-second and then gets blurry again. Depending on what is on screen, it's either very noticeable or barely noticeable, but it is always happening. It even happens on the ""Big Picture Mode"" menu, so it's not just ""in game"", it's the stream itself.

I've tried setting bitrate limits and no limits. I've tried fast, balanced, and beautiful quality, no difference in the behavior. I've updated my Linux distro and the Steam Link software itself. There has never been a time where it worked ""correctly"" for me.

My Pi4 is hard wired to the network. Even if I do 1080p with HEVC, the issue is present. If I switch over to software non HEVC encoding, everything looks great (as long as I'm at 1080p or lower, as the Pi4 struggles at higher resolutions without being able to use it's hardware HEVC decoder).

in my opinion AMD itself was stunned on the JHH show presenting the cards starting from 499$/699$ and I am sure that AMD real plans were to sell the 6800/6800XT at 650$/730$ price point

so, after the nvidia announcement they were forced to set a new price for the cards in that known 579$/649$ pricetag but what about the AIB? in my opinion they still started to make cards with that 730$ reference price in mind and there's no way we will see something below that line as the real cost isn't that 649$

Amd,"This just seems like AMD launching The  ""X"" SKU of CPU's as there is expected High Demand.

Only a small % of people bought the X variant of Previous Ryzen CPU's , And similarly only a small % of users buy's the super duper extra blah blah 250$ more than MSRP GPU. 

But this just seems like Alternative ways of scalping from the company's end . Just don't' release MSRP cards from First Party Manufacturers and Launch the Premium Tier's First

Nvidia stock is also limited but you can buy cards Like ASUS TUF which is amazing and is very close to MSRP. In fact Premium Tier Nvidia cards like MSI Suprim and ROG STRIX are launching almost a month after they announced their MSRP AIB cards.

 I'm just flabbergasted by pricing, I've borderline changed my mind from wanting to purchase a $650 RX 6800 XT to buy something like a $400 RTX 3060ti If I can't get my hands on MSRP card soon","Expensive AIB Cards From AMD's First Party Manufacturers XFX , Sapphire and PowerColor"

Amd,"Hey guys, just wanted to share my night of frustration to help save others from this mess. Hoping google searches will lead here too since no one was very clear about a fix when I looked it up.

Did you just get your zen 3 and are having problems getting any display out of your mobo? Did you follow Gigabytes SHIT instructions to a T but still no luck? Well I have just the solution for you!

So I knew I'd probably have to flash my mobo but the instructions said I'd need to go in to bios to do it, or press End on POST screen. Well that made me think my mobo was DOA since I couldn't get output from anything. Online posters claimed a DVI cable works when nothing else does, so I hunted one down with my old GPU and still nothing. Tried creating a support ticket on Gigabytes nightmare of a help center but gave up after the page signed me out half way through just by switching to another tab to check my ram model.

Rant done. Here's how you fix it. You need to download the latest BIOS file from their website. You need to rename the .1Fj or whatever file to ""GIGABYTE.bin"" (their website doesn't even mention this!!!) and put it on your fat32 formated USB stick. BTW I bought a 3.0 thumb drive specifically to do this. SURPRISE! It only works with a USB 2.0 stick. (Website doesn't mention this!) If it helps anyone I ended up using my cameras microSD with a USB2.0 adaptor and it worked. You need to have no cpu, ram, m.2, or videocard on the mobo, ONLY the 24 and 8 pin power cables.

Put the 2.0 stick on the white marked usb, flip the power on, and after a few seconds press the q-flash button. After a couple seconds it should start to flash the LED and the psu will spin the fan. It may reset during this process before continuing to flash the LED for a few more minutes. When its done it will stay on but the flashing will stop, then you can power it down and finish putting it all together.

Amd,"Since yesterday I've been experiencing some weird artifacts popping up randomly for a few milliseconds and then disappear, with no disearnable pattern . The artifacts can only be described as parts of my screen turning white with some RGB rectangles in it. Till now they've only occurred three times in a time span of around 8 hours. The artifactrs appear randomly, regardless of the GPUs usage or drivers (had them happen with 20.4.1 and the latest WHQL ones). I tried to replicate it through stress testing my rx vega 56 with games and different benchmarks, but nothing happened. Currently I'm testing if its my monitor (the 38GN950-b) with my r9 fury, but I highly doubt that its the culprit since this is a new panel and also I havent seen any artifacts pop up.

My rx vega 56 pulse is around 2.5 years old. My bios are stock and I've not increased the voltages pass the stock settings. That said ever since the beginning of this year, my normally stable UV OC of 1.070v at 50% power limit and 900mhz HBM has become unstable. I dont know if this is a sign of a degrading GPU, but I just ignored it and and set everything to stock.

This especially bums me out since I wasnt able to get a reference design 6800xt, I tolled to myself that its ok since I can wait till next year when the prices will normalize (reference design cost arount 720 CHF which was ok, but AIBs now cost 850 CHF which I'm not willing to pay). I can still wait, especially since we're in a middle of a pandemic which is affecting everything, but its still a hard pill to swallow.

Amd,"Hey guys, I wanted to write my own experience with updating the BIOS on a ASUS motherboard for anyone upgrading to 4th Gen Ryzen.

Last night I had some trouble flashing a new bios on my Asus B550-i Gaming using the flashback button (brand new motherboard, needed the new bios to boot with my 5600x). I followed the instructions provided on the user manual but with no luck: **the indicator LED would just blink 3 times and then stay on. No blinking, no activity light on the USB stick, nothing.** I tried different USB sticks with different capacities, different bios versions, still nothing.

So, I found out after some digging that the USB stick needs to be a **MRB disk (Master Boot Record)** instead of a **GPT (GUID Partition Table)** for the motherboard to be able to read the bios file and install it. My knowledge of what both of these acronyms are and in what regard they differ is very limited, but I'll leave you with the steps I followed to prepare my USB stick.

1. Connect your USB to the computer;
2. Press **Windows key + R** to open RUN;
3. Type **diskpart**, it should open a cmd window;
4. Type **list disk**. Note the disk number of your USB;
5. Type **select disk &lt;disk number&gt;**;
6. Type **clean**;
7. Type **convert mbr**;
8. Type **create partition primary**;
9. Type **format fs=fat32 quick**;
10. Type **active**;
11. Exit the cmd window.

Now you should have a fresh MRB USB disk, ready to receive the BIOS file and flash it to your motherboard.",My experience flashing the bios on a ASUS Strix B550-i Gaming

Now, hear me out. I have a little bit to say, and I'm not going to waste your time.

That doesn't mean that Frank Azor should have been taking shots at Nvidia for having no cards at launch, when the same situation happened for AMD. But to truly evaluate the launches of the cards, and which is a paper launch and which isn't, we shouldn't be yelling at AMD, and calling them evil 2 weeks after their launch, and we have to wait and see, since they have only had 2 weeks, versus 2 months for nvidia.

Yesterday, was apparently an embargo, not even a release date. So, I'm just telling everyone on this subreddit, and hell, if this explodes or something, people who are going to read this, please be patient. Only two weeks have passed. I get that this is a sucky year, to say the least, but these cards will come back in stock, whether that be Nvidia or AMD. We just need to wait until they do.

For the people who'll say I'm an AMD fanboy, I'm not. I don't even have a AMD graphics card, because of it not being available. But what I am saying is just... Wait. I am just as frustrated, believe me, with the lack of stock on any major retailer, because at around 9 AM, I was looking through Newegg, looking through everything, F5ing, only to get nothing. Then I went through B&amp;H, but they weren't selling anything, I went to best buy, online, then literally going to eBay to negotiate pricing from scalpers, before just giving up  But I was also looking, at 9 AM, for 3080s, on September 17th, looking through Best Buy, Newegg, B&amp;H, and eventually going across my state to go to a Microcenter, only to find it out of stock, and going back with nothing to show for it. Same thing happened with the 3070 on October 29th, because I thought there was more stock. But there wasn't. But I knew, that I had to wait, if I could get the card.

All we can do is wait. Wait and see. There are a whole slew of other problems with the pricing of AIBs, but I'm not going to get into that, since I'm not exactly like MLID, NAAF, or HU, where they have direct access to AIBs, and even companies and corporations. What I can say, as someone who's traveled across Virginia just to get a fucking graphics card, and coming back with nothing, we have to wait. We can't call AMD having a paper launch, or a post it note launch, without waiting. So... Let's wait together.

Amd,"I'm one of the lucky few that was able to snag a 5600x and so started my first AMD build in over 15 years.  Not as intimate with this platform, I did what I normally do which is to install the ASUS suite of drivers and applications on a fresh windows 10 install.  I used AI suite 3 on my intel ASUS build for the fan controller and it never created a problem on my x270 board w/ 7700k.  

After installing the Armoury Crate app with the AI Suite 3 I started noticing shut down was slow with ""Armouryswagenname"" refusing to stop.  Assumed this was a problem with the Armoury Crate app.  Tried uninstalling it - seemed to uninstall cleanly but AI suite 3 I kept.  Still had slowness on shut down.

Benchmarked Middle Earth Shadow of War using same settings on my intel build.  All I changed was the 5600x, x570 and 3600 memory (vs 3200 on intel).  Still using 1080 ti and same graphic settings.  7700k was 4.8 all core OC

Benchmark on 7700k: 97 FPS 

Benchmark on 5600x: 84 FPS, then 86 FPS, then 87, then 88.  best I could get was 88...but it was inconsistent.  I'm thinking...wtf?  This isn't how this should be going.  Granted I'm running 4.65 stock clocks vs 4.8 but...still.  Something's wrong.

So I reformat.  Follow the same install process...this time didn't install armoury crate...just AI Suite.  Consistent this time at least but 87 FPS every time.  

Then I tried uninstalling AI Suite 3...seemed like it went fine....but still slowness on shut down...and FPS unchanged.  But then I started noticing the device removed noise on startup.  Something was still wrong.

Finally decided to do a third reformat.  Installed Armoury Crate this time with JUST DRIVERS.  No AI Suite 3.  Everything else the same.  Same software, same install order, same settings.

Benchmark now on 5600x: 95.  Then 95.  Then 95.  Then 95.  Consistent and as is would expect compared to an overclocked 7700k in gaming.  

TL;DR: DO NOT install AI Suite 3.  Control fans in bios.  8-10% gaming performance hit on a fresh clean install with nothing different outside of AI Suite 3 that cannot be corrected by uninstalling (and yeah I did ccleaner registry cleanup) is simply unacceptable...and nearly had me VERY disappointed in AMD over all this...when it was just shitty software from ASUS.","PSA: ASUS x570 users - AI suite 3 kills performance and once installed, cannot be cleaned up"

Like with the 1080ti, because it's just ridiculously not getting put to use as much with either cpu, I'm wondering here if the 3300x wins only because there was so much more wiggle room to play with. 

Reasoning for my question here is because my first pc build, upcoming in a handful of months, I was thinking of a 3100 with a 1660ti. But then I read, heard, and saw the dust up with the 3300x and now I'm completely wanting to flip and go with it. My only concern is that I believe at a minimum the 1660ti gets as little used as like 95% in certain games. Is my thinking wrong here in that with that little left to make up for 99% usage, that the 3300x won't actually perform better than the 3100?

With Nvidia's stock being non-existent and priced gouged and the realization that getting a 6800 XT any time soon will probably not happen, we decided to go ahead and buy two Red Devil 5700 XTs to replace my 580 and his 480. We still game at 1080p, but the 580 is showing its age in some titles and we want to max out what we currently play. Being that we have 1080p 144hz monitors, maybe the smarter choice was us buying these 5700 XTs. Probably should have done it a lot sooner.

Watched a couple of reviews that I could find, Nitro+, Red Devil, XFX Merc Speedster whatever. They are not better than the reference card in any way that I'd find meaningful. Couple more fps, couple of degrees cooler, can't say they are significantly quieter. Dual bios... I just want a card to play on, not OC. And only the higher tier cards have the Type-C port that I need, so that's fun.

And barely any of them would fit in my case with 315mm length clearance.

After the GN review I was kind of made to believe the reference cooling was not that amazing and can be improved by partners. Everyone put a dumptruck size cooler on the thing, but to what end? Probably my expectations took a wrong turn somewhere.

I was quite surprised how pumped HUB Steve seemed at the end of the Nitro+ review, so I watched it twice, but I couldn't find anything amazing to be excited about. Derbauer was more into how much more OC can potentially be achieved on the Red Devil, so I kinda got that. OC3D I don't watch ever, but he was the only one with XFX, and it didn't seem very high standards testing so that's a pass. KitGuru, similar to HUB.

Amd,"First and foremost, I don’t think the launch of the new cards was very good so far, especially AIBs. However I see a lot of people saying it’s a ""paper launch"". And here in europe it definitely feels like one. But in all fairness for AMD, they would have never been able to cover the demand, even if they tried. 
Nvidia usually covers 80% of the whole GPU market and AMD takes the remaining 20%. Because of NVIDIA’s struggle to have some decent amount of ampere stock, it all kind of fell into AMD’s hands.
And to be clear AMD did try, according to MLID  they increased GPU production but it’s still far from enough to cover what NVIDIA left on the table.

So dear folks please be patient, it’s only been the first week, no need to write the devil on the wall just yet.
Many of us and myself included waited the whole year for the next generation of GPU’s. The frustration of not getting one is understandable but this outrage isn’t. I’m sure if AMD could, they would love to hand everyone a 6800/XT but you’re kind of expecting the impossible.

I can't push it any higher with less than 1.4v so I won't even bother. I tried lowering the voltage but keeping a 48 multi and it didn't really like that either. I'm sort of hard locked in what might be a golden zone?

Not only are these people sacrificing their own health, but IMO they're also making the rest of us look bad by lashing out here, and at this point the community can do without them. 

Furthermore, even if we don't get a megathread to clean up the sub, the majority of this stuff can also be removed as duplicates. Most of these posts can be boiled down to ""fuck AMD"", ""fuck scalpers"", ""fuck retailers"", ""fuck bots"", ""fuck you"", ""there's no stock"", ""there was stock, but it was gone by the second I pressed submit"".

Or we could just rename the sub to /r/fuckAMD. It would reflect the current content better.",Can we get an official launch/stock complaint megathread please?

Amd,"Hey everyone,

I was one of many, who didn't get the reference 6800 XT from AMD last week. I was hoping that today might be the day, but the Danish supplier of the 3rd party cards just made a statement about, saying they received so few cards, that they won't even put them up for sale at 3 PM (Danish time) today.

Instead, we'll be able to sign up for an email notification when they choose to put them up for sale, and as I understand it, whoever signs up first will be first in line whenever they become available.

Amd,"What's up??

If you're not into overclocking and getting the most from your CPU, this might be boring for you.. Also, I'm sorry if you all know this and I'm late to the party (:

If you're doing the same and testing, please post your results and share what you're doing to achieve them so we can all learn from it!!!

I have a 5900X and I'm currently playing with the ""Curve Optimizer"" and am getting the best results I've seen on my CPU!

**I'm getting 646 single core and over 8900 muti in r20!**

*A little context..*

I thought I was getting the best performance I could without a manual overclock by using custom PBO settings and setting the curve optimizer to negative 10 all core. 

I couldn't get lower than negative 10 to work for all core. I even tried doing per-core and at first I tried increasing on what I thought were my best cores (through HWInfo).. I tried -15 on a few different ones at different times and it just didn't work for me.

I was tired of trying things and gave up for a while..

With a manual 4.7GHz OC I was looking at 8900-9100 (mostly below 9000) in r20 but my single core score would suffer, dropping to \~617 from \~635. I even tried per CCX (or CCD?) overclocking and it just wasn't stable, 4.7GHz all-core seemed to be the best manual OC I could get.

Before, I was using the curve optimizer and only PBO and was seeing \~8500 multi and - 625 single which was easy to reproduce.

With custom PBO + negative 10 all-core curve optimizer I was just barely getting over 8700 multi and \~635 single (642 was max I've EVER seen and couldn't reproduce it). 

**After adjusting the curve optimizer per core**, along with PBO, I was able to get 8950 multi and 646 single in r20. Over 640 is now common.

**That's nearly as good as a manual OC, I can literally get the same multi core score now AND get higher single core score! That's exactly what I've been working towards!**

**ALL-CORE OVERCLOCKING IS DEAD!**

I was hitting 5GHz here and there but now I'm hitting over that just ever so slightly AND more often. I'm seeing 5150MHz on one core, 5075MHz on another and 5050MHz on the third one that reaches 5GHz. I've actually seen two of them hit 5150MHz but not sure if was at the same time (probably not).

I'm seeing 4850MHz and 4775MHz often on several cores (up to 6) while playing Apex when it use to be 4400-4675MHz. I'm also seeing 5GHz while playing when I've never seen that before while playing Apex. What this translates to actual FPS I have no fucking clue. 

**What did I do?** 

After seeing the thread about PBO2 with the video (didn't watch it) and seeing AMD\_Roberts replies, it regained my interest, so I went back to the BIOS to try a couple things..

Instead of sticking to one number for curve optimizer for all core, or just trying to set what I thought were the best cores to lower numbers, I actually started from the bottom, raising each number except for the top 5 (because I tried higher numbers before and failed) and did a lot of testing. I could get the bottom number to 70 but that didn't help much more than 40.

**Currently, this is what's getting the results above (curve optimizer per-core):**

1. Negative 10
2. Negative 10
3. Negative 10
4. Negative 10
5. Negative 10
6. Negative 35
7. Negative 35
8. Negative 35
9. Negative 35
10. Negative 35
11. Negative 35
12. Negative 35

Seems simple right? Maybe some of you already figured this out, but for those who want to push your CPU a little more, do some testing. Try my numbers. BUT also try testing other numbers and combinations.. Each CPU may work differently.

I did eventually try higher numbers again in the top 5 but it resulted in crashes or lower r20 scores. I tried positive numbers here and there, I tried keeping a few cores the same numbers, I tried decreasing in increments from bottom to top. For instance, I tried (from the bottom) 70, 60, 50, 40, 35, 30, 25, 15, 10, 10, 10, 10.. I saw a decrease in performance but it still allowed me to run tests without crashing. This is all kind of weird and new to me.

My PBO settings are manually set to:

* Precision Boost Overdrive: ADVANCED
* PBO Limits: MOTHERBOARD
* PBO Scalar: Manual, 5X
* MAX CPU PBO: 200MHz
* Platform Thermal Throttle Limit: 255 (max)

SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO NOTE: before I was playing heavily with the curve optimizer, I found that OCing the RAM, whether increasing frequency or tightening the timings, DECREASED PERFORMANCE (on top of the WHEA errors obviously)!!!! That's why I'm running XMP ONLY at the moment. But after playing with the curve, I might try tweaking it again, but may have to wait for a BIOS update. Not sure.

**Here's my specs (RAM is running XMP only!):**

* 5900X
* B550 Gaming Carbon
* GTX 1080 TI
* 2x16GB Crucial Ballistix RGB 3600 Cl16 Dual Rank
* RM850",Curve Optimizer - Better Than Manual OC!

But people seem to all be falling towards the idea that these cards were only worth it because they undercut nvidia.  Why buy an 800 dollar 6800xt when you can get a 750 dollar 3080?

Well, thats changing FAST.

https://twitter.com/_RTXBot_/status/1331734769135017984?s=19

The 3080s are climbing in price fast at retailers.   Sure if youre in the queue with EVGA, cool. 

But nvidia AIBs are starting to charge 150 dollar premiums too for similar features as the AMD AIBs.  Because Nvidia's prices were fake MSRP.  

The reality is, the 800 dollar cards arent crazy at all (from a market perspective) because Nvidia was ALWAYS going to go up (theres been rumblings for weeks that AIBs have been pissed at Nvidia for having almost no margin on their cards at MSRP).   And now they are, so in a really fucked up way, AMD is STILL undercutting Nvidia. 


Hope you got your reference models becsuse it sounds like the 6800xt is going to be an 800 dollar card and the 3080 is gonna be a 850+ card for the foreseeable future.   We all lost the game.",AIB pricing for AMD is just the beginning

I’m new to pc building. I finished my first build 2 weeks ago.

I use obs to record, not stream.

Which is better for my options?

6800xt or 3080?

I heard 6900xt or 3090 would bottleneck and drop frames.

Personally I want the highest frames while playing/recording to really utilize my 240hz monitor investment playing in 1080p, 24 inches only.

I don’t care for graphics and all of that even tho I’ll be playing on Warzone highest settings.

I’m a noob to this so a slight breakdown would be great. A lot of benchmarks on YouTube put the 6800xt getting higher frames but not all are showing benchmarks for 1080p. 

So to ask again, 6800xt or 3080 for Warzone, highest settings, recording via obs?

And would the 6900xt or 3090 be bad? Or is it toooo much overkill as Warzone really isn’t even optimized that much for pc. 

If I can’t get any of these cards, I may just grab a 2080ti until the stocks go up, grab a new card and give the 2080ti to my nephew. (Not worried that the 2080ti is still expensive. Price isn’t an issue.) Yet knowing prices aren’t an issue, I rather go for best performance at 1080p with the least bottlenecks or issues. Might also get the 5950x when stocks level out.","Honestly, 3080 vs 6800 xt?"

Amd," Hi fellow AMD supporters.

I have an AMD RX 6800 on the way! (Managed to pry it from the cold dead hands of the bots!). I plan on keeping this card either for the short run until I can get a hold of the 6800XT, which was impossible to get on launch day in the UK or I am considering just keeping it for the long run as I need to direct funds else where next year.

My builds theme is cyan with a touch of pink, check out my battlestation post for context. Ain't no place for red I'm sorry (minus the Godlike's wee LEDs). If I am going to keep the 6800 for the long run (depends on how it preforms at Ultra/V/High 4k) I want to customise the shroud and led logo. Likely with paint and maybe something clever to remove the red plastic led cover.

I've watch ~~GamersNexus's~~ Tech Jesus's teardown and I see the cards cooler uses a thermal pad. If I dismantle this card for customisation, can I reuse the pads and thermal interface?

That is why I decided to create a Discord server to keep track of stock on several stores (US only). I found a few asking for one over the past few days so decided to make one hoping it helps. 

Once you join you will have to use one (or more) of the reactions there to pick the model you want and as soon as any online shop (online only) adds stock you will receive a notification on Discord. 

This will not buy it for you, or even secure one in cart for you. This will only notify you when there is stock so you will have to react fast. This is still a beta service so I still recommend checking shops yourself, joining other servers or F5/CMD+R all day long.

Amd,"I’ve been in the pc hobby for a few years now and I decided to upgrade. I went from a rx 580, to a rtx 3070. So far the performance is way better, obviously, but it isn’t quite as high as i would like. In gta v I get around 60 FPS on ultra with only a few settings turned to high. My utilization is around 70 to 90 on cpu and only under 80 on gpu. CS go is worse. On low settings with high shadows I get around only 200 FPS with 70 percent utilization on gpu and 80 on cpu. Newer games like Cold War on ultra everything including ray tracing gets between 70 and 90 FPS. All games are run in 1080p on a 240 hz monitor. Cpu has a 36.00 multiplier and gpu has a slight clock speed oc to just over 2 ghz, along with around +500 MHz on vram. I have never touched voltage or power limit on anything including ram.

Amd,"The current lack of supply for new CPUs / GPUs is incredibly frustrating, but if anyone deserves the #1 spot for worst negative backlash, it should be the retailers. Why?

* Egregious failure to counteract bots and address coordinated scalping efforts. No CAPTCHAs, no checkout priority for ""known good"" customer accounts, etc. **There is basically ZERO risk for scalpers to do what they do. At best, they make 100% profit or more, and at worst they can sell surplus product right at MSRP and take minimal (if any) losses.**
* Failure to implement a queue or other signup system, without which many people resort to using stock trackers or refreshing webpages. Even with these tools, most are still easily outraced by bots and those who want to secure their own purchases waste many hours dealing with this. Queue systems let customers quickly and easily secure their spot in line (and monitor it over time) without the stress and time waste that comes with having to constantly track retailer inventories. (Some retailers do this but they are outliers)
* Inadequate communication on release dates/times, prices, product listing pages, etc. ""Hiding the listing pages"" isn't an effective bot countermeasure and if anything gives scalpers another advantage, as they have greater ability to find products immediately when (or before) they go live. Obfuscation hurts real customers and does not make up for a lack of legitimate countermeasures.
* **Most importantly, these problems have happened countless times before and yet are still not addressed in meaningful ways.** 

Obviously AMD and Nvidia deserve some negative backlash for how these launches have gone (not to mention some of the relevant Twitter fiascos), as everyone down the chain must ultimately answer to them if they want orders fulfilled. **Were there always going to be major shortages? Yes. But there are also far more graceful - and less stressful - ways that retailers could be addressing this situation.** This needs to change moving forward.",Unpopular Opinion: Retailers deserve the bulk of the criticism for recent launch failures

Amd,"So this is all anecdotal, and far from scientific, just my own personal observations...so grain of salt and all that.

System specs:
CPU: AMD 5900x
Motherboard: MSI Meg x570 Godlike
Videocard: Zotac 3090 Trinity
Memory: 32 GB 4000 MHz Crucial Ballistic Max RGB
Boot drive: Samsung 980 1 tb
Case: Bequiet Dark Base 900
Power Supply: Bequiet 1100 watt

Assembled the system and on initial power up found the pump on the Corsair h150i was DOA, and I noticed that the Dark Rock could ship and arrive in a few hours so I ordered it and installed it. Fired up a fresh windows install and ran some benchmarks and Prome 95 to test the Dark Rock out.

I booted the RAM into the xmp profile (4000 MHz) and set the Infinity Fabric fclk to 3800 (i know its uncoupled, but MSI hasn't released the updated BIOS yet and I didn't feel like testing out my motherboard yet to see if out of the box it could support 1:1)

For what its worth I also undervolted the 3090, which surprisingly gave me HIGHER number in firestrike and time spy.

My idle temps with the system like this were 51 C. Ran Prime 95 for 8 hours and saw 91 C.

A few days later my Corsair h150i came in so I installed that. This bequiet case has some quirks. If you want to install the AIO radiator on the front you interfere with the ability to mount mechanical drives, and a top mounted radiator has air flow restrictions. Since I have a bunch of mechanical hard drives I couldn't install it on the front, so that left the top.

So the next question is fans on top or underneath, and is the air intake or exhaust? Perfect world i guess it'd be exhaust with the two 140 mm fans on the front supplying fresh air intake, but if you exhaust with the radiator up top and the fans underneath the hot air being pushed up through the radiator doesn't have much space to freely exhaust. If you swap the fans to the top and try to draw air through it made me wonder how efficient it'd be and I thought I'd try to just suck fresh outside air into the case through the radiator.

I know theoretically I'd be just getting that air up and blowing it INTO the case, but here were my thoughts:

1. The warm air would blow directly down and into the air path of the 140 mm exhaust fan located right below.
2. Any air not immediately exhausted would blow onto the CPU, which is being cooled by colder outside air not inside case air...sooooo...net positive I guess?
3. I didn't think to measure motherboard temps before, but after its sitting at 39 right now, which I'm not terribly worried about.

So, long winded explanation aside, installing the Corsair AIO dropped my idle temps by 10 C to 40 C and my load with Prime 95 running for 8 hours by 13 C to 78 C.

These temps seem fairly cool, there doesn't seem to be a lot of temp data out there yet about the 5900 yet, so I'm not sure.

But I can say that this AIO seems to work really well. It was a lot easier to install than the Dark Rock, too.

Amd,"It isn't a big deal that AMD doesn't have stock. They have too much on limited fab right now with the amount they have to dedicate to console and CPU. GPU has to take the back seat to these 2, they have to honour deals with Sony and Microsoft and Ryzen has a better reputation so needs the fab space to prop that up and keep the intel beat down going. Especially for Ryzen as this is getting to market asap to claim the crown before 11th gen intel potentially takes it back.


It is also unexpected that Nvidia would have stock shortages, AMD usually cater to a smaller market share so we can forgive them for thinking Nvidia would have good supply and only there would be only small demand for people taking up Radeon cards at the high end. This is not where Radeon has garnered any reputation over the past few years.


Add to that higher covid demand with no room to mitigate that, and it's fairly clear that something miraculous would have to happen to make huge numbers of Radeon chips.


But why the paper launch? Why not stockpile a little first?
I think this is the first anticonsumer bit, they have clearly rushed to market to get the reviews out showing 6000 series is competitive with Nvidia. This will make consumer hold out for Radeon cards and not go Nvidia right away. This is a bit of a dick move as they will be launching knowing they won't have enough stock and so will be leaving consumers waiting but hopefully enough will. This makes business sense, better than doing the initial announcement now when prospective buyers have already decided to go Nvidia, and I think is part of the normal games these companies play at launch. This is the reason for paper launch, and I get it.

The bit I really don't get at all, is AMD saying they will have stock, saying they will have more volume than Nvidia and making bets on twitter this will be the case. The only theory here would be that again, like the last point, they are trying to get people to hang on to the commitment to Radeon as long as possible. But it's kind of obvious that will blow up in their face. Maybe they're hoping the anger would be short lived, and at least some of those waiting for Radeon will carry on and not switch to Nvidia.

This really flies in the face of the 'good guy' persona AMD had been promoting. Bringing huge generational leaps in CPU without significant price hikes for the whole Ryzen series, having reasonably accurate benchmarks in launch demos, unlike nvidias crazy charts and 8k dodgy claims. They have a populous sub here and a lot of fanboys for the reason that they are rejecting a lot of anti consumer practices. They could have kept that going by being honest about stock and won a greater mindshare of people thinking 'this honesty is refreshing'.

I know everyone says they're just a company, they're after you're money, well that's true, but AMD was getting the huge underdog support and making their money based partly on their more consumer friendly practices. Sure they did it for more sales and money, but that's the way a free market should work, we vote with our money. I think their recent lies have put us in denial whether it's worth voting for them. They no longer seem consumer friendly, instead just a slightly cheaper, non-RT GPU, which to me is kinda meh.",Yet another stock post

Amd,"Hello everyone,

I'd like some guidance on how AMD is handling RMA requests, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(The following is mere background. I don't feel this belongs in the tech support megathread, because I'm confident I know what the issue is.)

I received my AMD Ryzen 7 5800X in the mail last Thursday and installed it into my computer with no problems. It worked perfectly until Saturday, when I began to notice artifacting on images and videos on multithread applications that like to use as many cores as possible, including Firefox, Discord, and Darktable.

I deduced that the CPU had a faulty core by running a simple blend test with Prime95. At stock clocks and voltages, the first seven cores were running this benchmark perfectly, while the threads (workers) in the eighth core (15 and 16) instantly failed the test and told me about a hardware error. So I disabled the eighth core in msconfig, and the artifacts disappeared after I restarted my computer. They only appear when the eighth core is activated.

I opened an RMA request with AMD this morning. However, I've never had to do this before, so I'm not entirely sure what to expect from them, much less from any RMA process at all—especially during a global disease outbreak that's constrained AMD and its ability to support its customers, one way or another. So I have a few questions for /r/AMD:

1. Has COVID-19 impacted AMD's RMA process in any way?
2. What turnaround time can I expect for an RMA request for a newly released CPU?
3. Have you personally done an RMA with AMD during this time? I'd be interested in hearing your personal stories.

Thanks very much!",Guide this noob to AMD's RMA process—a borked AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and the COVID-19 pandemic
Amd,"I'm no AMD fan boy. In fact, I have hardware from Intel, AMD, Nvidia in active use. This short comment isn't meant to sugarcoat the highly disappointing launch. I'm disappointed, too. The issue AMD ran into is a combination of things AMD knew beforehand and things that AMD could not predict. 

What AMD knew: 

During the course of 2020, manufacturing of PS5 and Xbox APU, new Ryzen and Epyc and also manufacturing of the new Radeon GPUs would all happen on the same limited 7 nm node capacity that AMD bought at TSMC. 

AMD knew that it would have to fulfill important manufacturing contracts at first. Business customers (EPYC, Radeon Instinct) and their relations with Microsoft and Sony are most important right now. They knew that there would be a high risk that their limited capacity at TSMC might become overloaded.

What AMD didn't know:

Covid 19. Supply chain issues. Extreme demand on IT parts all over the world. Very limited space on cargo ships. As of now, it's almost impossible to get space on cargo ships. That's why a lot of products from Asia are low on stock in Europe or USA. Prices for air freight also increased. Early 2020, shipping one kilogramme via plane cost about 1,20 bucks. A while later, that price went up to 7 bucks. And as passenger flight travel is down, the cargo space in all those planes that happen to be on the ground now is missing, creating delays in the shipment of light items like a CPU or a stick of RAM.

A possible conclusion:

Private customers like you and me, even the enthusiasts, are of importance regarding pushing brand value/public view of a company. But we are of lesser financial importance than their business customers which is why we currently get the leftovers that come of a silicon die. Simply put: We, as the single customer, has low priority in the big scheme of things. 

If Covid hadn't happened and demand for IT parts was normal, I think the launch of RTX3000, RDNA2 and Ryzen would have went better than the shit show we're seeing right now. 

If AMD had the possibility of buying more TSMC capacity, they would have done so 100% percent, as they could have made way more revenue if they had items in stock. They simply couldn't as TSMC can only sell them so much: They have other customers, too. 

My prediction is, that we won't see an improvement in the coming weeks or even months. The worldwide shortage on IT parts will remain for a bit and the issues in the supply chains will remain, too. A manager of a huge German logistics company said, and I quote:

""We have everything that can swim on the water.""

Nvdia could also develop arm apu with nvidia graphics for laptop or desktop.

Amd,"So I, hyped about the new gaming gains, ordered 5600x few weeks ago. Received the processor surprisingly, 2 days after that. I also ordered msi b550m mortar, after evaluating what board would be good, and easy to setup. Without too much hastle with the update. After 2 weeks of wait it finally arrived, and here begins my horror story.

So I was pretty sure that I would need to update my bios, but I had no way to know that for sure, but to try the board. I had every part for the pc ready, so why not just build the pc, and update the bios if I needed to. First mistake. 

So for no ones suprise, it didn't boot, got EZ CPU light on. So I thought yeah, I need to update the bios. I open the manual, check how to do it, download the latest stable bios for 5600x, and do as the manual suggests. I plug the stick, and start the update. After 10 mins, I start to think that this shouldn't take this long, but afraid to turn the pc down, I let it run. After 1h 30min - 2h I gave up, and started searching around internet.

Apparently lots of people have this same exact problem. And the solution to this is to use program like Rufus to format disk to fat32 MBR. And no other components attached to mb, besides power supply. So I did that. No progress. Apparently people are saying that it depends a lot of your usb stick, and it works only on some sticks.

So I gather all usb sticks of my crib, and also borrow few from roommate. Total 7 usb sticks. Format all to the correct format, put the bios there, and start running the updates. No stick works. 

So me and my roommate think after about 4 hours of bs, that this pretty fcking stupid, and we should just disamble his 3600x from his pc, and just use that CPU to upgrade the bios. It didn't even boot. Neither did the flashback do anything different. 

So I do my last efforts to fix this. Search the exact usb sticks, people have got this bios to update with. Go and drive 10km to nearest store that sell them and buy 2. Now at this point I was pretty frustrated, so I thought, I'm gonna do this EXACTLY as in manual, just to be sure, and not to do any community suggestions. Nothing. So I do the community suggestions. Still nothing.

So, after 7+ hours, about 9 hours in total if you count the initial assembly, I figured that if me and roommate with about 15 pcs collectively can't update this bios, it's either that we are too stupid to update this bios, or the motherboard is broken. Going for the latter, I finally just returned the motherboard.

In total, this operation required 2 Ryzen processors, 9 usb sticks, in sizes 8,16,32. Usb 2.0 and 3.0. This is a story I think everyone who was dreaming of easy fresh ryzen 5000 build should hear.

Amd,"As the title suggests I am interested in the 5800x as this is the last cpu my strix x570-I will take and want to get around 3 years out of it. I like stuff running in the background and sometimes stream with a friend so I opted for more than 6 cores. 

I play vr games and have a rtx 3070 and thought the single ccx 5800x made sense for latency. I know it will likely get hotter than the 5900x because of the single ccx. I don’t need this as a workstation. 

I understand the 5800x isn’t good from a value proposition and could be $50 cheaper. I understand for $100 more I get a lot more cores and slight single core boost. But if I don’t need the cores and more cores doesn’t necessarily make it last a lot longer is it worth it. (Forget about availability for a minute)

Amd,"I don't know much about computers, and I don't know anything about Risc-V to comment on it. I see that ARM has a ton of upside to its potential, especially in the hands of companies like Apple and Nvidia who can really help it reach new heights. And maybe new nodes from TSMC plus AMD's creative ingenuity will keep x86 competitive for at least 5 years. 

For those of you more knowledgeable in processors and computing performance, do you see a point at which ARM overtakes X86, and will the two trend parallel with one another, or will ARM leave X86 in the dust? Can AMD (or Intel) core power, along with 3D stacking and other breakthroughs that may come in the future, be enough to compete with ARM in 5 years? And at new nodes such as 5nm, 3nm, and beyond that, does that allow X86 to stay relevant?

Sorry if I sound ignorant because I'm kind of new to technology and stuff.

I've been trying to OC my RAM to get the most out of my system (2 x 8gb T Force Delta RGB 3200mhz CL16) and I've not been having success past 3200 using a modified XMP profile. I even tried using Thaiphoon and the Ryzen DRAM Calculator. No dice using even the ""safe"" values.

So, I let my BIOS due the tweaking for me. I manually set a 36 multiplier and 1.45 voltage and let the motherboard auto adjust the timings (I run a B450 Aorus M). I was able to get a stable 3600mhz clock, but at CL22. For the sake of trying, I tried playing some CoD Warzone and to my amazement, I'm actually getting around +20 fps compared to the normal 3200 mhz XMP profile.

My understanding is that the Infinity Fabric on the 3300x runs at the DRAM frequency, therefore higher is desired. But I also read that shorter latencies should generally lead to better gaming performance. Is my manual OC really better than the default XMP? Or is this simply a one-off case for one game, and I shouldn't expect the same results in others?",Higher RAM frequency or lower timings for 3300x?

Any leaks showing off dual hdmi ports on any of the 3ed party 6800xt cards yet?

Want to throw a signal to my oled and projector and the 2nd hdmi poet would be key. 

I've seen asus and gigabyte embrace the dual hdmi outputs for their nvidia cards but haven't seen leaks of their amd offerings.

I guess I could try usb-c to hdmi w/something like this but not sure if it'll work consistently + adds another point of failure.

Amd,So I saw that on my motherboard It said compatible with third generation AMD CPUs and me being an Intel fan thought that meant Zen 3 architecture so I tried booting up my newly built 5800X build without flashing the motherboard BIOS and it ended up bricking after many attempts. Stupid me.,I confused 3rd gen with zen 3...and bricked my motherboard
Amd,"So I have found that the orientation of the 6800XT can drastically affect the cooling, has anyone else noticed / able to confirm this?

* Motherboard horizontal, GPU vertical - excellent cooling, \~60-70C hotspot, even cooler 'GPU' temp. (coincidentally, how nearly every review seems to test)
* Motherboard vertical, GPU horizontal (sideways sag) - reasonable cooling, \~75+C hotspot, slightly cooler 'GPU' temp.
* Motherboard 90^(o) vertical, GPU vertical (length ways, 90^(o)) - horrendous cooling, 110C+ hotspot, 75C+ 'GPU' temp.

Now in my tests hitting the 110C hotspot causes the card to throttle back quite heavily (2-300hz) and rightly so if 90^(o) vertical placement causes the vapour chamber to cease to function. It surprised me because (with my limited knowledge on them) if the chamber worked so well in the vertical on a horizontal motherboard I foolishly assumed it would work just as well vertical 'longways' (90^(o) rotation).",6800(XT) card orientation seems to make a difference

Amd,"Just upgraded or so I thought from a 2080TI, to a Reference 6800XT.  I am running a Pimax 8kx (4K) and this runs notably slower (10-20%) than the Nvidia ?  New to team red am I missing anything on settings? This seems very odd.

My other thoughts are either Drivers need some work or that maybe 4k is too much for this card.

This is being run on Iracing which is a pretty basic in terms of graphics and load.  I was getting 75-80 frames before now barely 60fps

Update: Both cards were OC'd with blowers, I had to OC the XT as it was just horrible in rage mode.

Update 2:  Decided to sell **not** scalp the card, after looking into the babel review in more detail on the 4k pancake its evident that the 6800xt is not great at 4k.  You can see in most of the games there is like a 25-30% delta between the 3080 an XT.  Which is about inline with what Nvidia said it comparing the 3080 to a 2080 which was about 50% and more likely about 25-30% on the TI.

This is probably great with the added benefit of SAM for any regular HMD (Index, G2, Vive Pro, Quest(s) or rift S).  Card works much better at 2k or lower.

But ultimately 4k isn't great if your upgrading from a TI, hold out for maybe the 6900xt or 3080TI (if memory is a concern)",Amd 6800XT in VR is it really this bad?

##Now get to posting!",Q4'20 Tech Support Megathread
Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### Where can you get this test version?
- Windows: [Installer](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.exe) [Archive (.7z)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.7z) [Archive (.zip)](https://cdn.xaymar.com/releases/streamfx/pr-291/streamfx-windows2019-0.9.0.44-9b3ae3af.zip)

Install guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki/Installation).

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software.

Amd,"I think it is pretty clear that the debacle of the RDNA2 6000 series launch having been in orders of magnitude worse than Nvidia RTX 3000 series begs the question. I mean, it was (and is) so bad that AIBs have taken it upon themselves to directly dig even further the Rx 6000 series with insane prices of the AIB models and some retailers in Europe are straight up scalping these cards despite having no stocks. 

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro. So, in Germany you can get scalped with all the perks of buying directly from a retailer.

Amd,"Hey guys! I’ve been super lucky to pick up a RTX 3080 and a 5800x! Wanted to share some tips and tricks I have found to help the community out. Please upvote this if it helps you out.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

I wanted to share that I've got a Ryzen 5 2600 up and running on an MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard. Here is a CPU-Z validation: [https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq](https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq)

I'm creating this post, because I couldn't find enough information, if the motherboard will work with my CPU. Officially, the CPU is not supported by the motherboard (and from the B550 Chipset in general), but I found some comments here on Reddit and other forums that it might work, so I decided to give it a try. Here is what I had to do however, in order to get everything up and running.

Initially, the motherboard didn't boot with the Ryzen 5 2600. I decided to try and update the BIOS with MSI's Flashback to the latest BIOS version 7C91v14. With the CPU still in the socket, the Flashback didn't work as well, although theoretically it should work even with an installed CPU. The red LED for the Flashback blinked multiple times and then stayed solid for over 10 minutes and the other lights on the motherboard didn't light up, which meant that the Flashback isn't working.

I had to remove absolutely everything (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU) from the motherboard and leave only the 8 PIN CPU power connector and the 24 PIN power connector. After the BIOS flash, I installed the CPU, RAM, GPU and SSD and the PC booted without any problems. Everything (PCI-E Gen 3 including NVMe, SATA, XMP Profiles, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) seems to be working fine for now. The CPU is also recognized in the BIOS correctly.

One small note about using the Flashback: The USB drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and an MBR scheme. The flash might not work, if the scheme is not MBR.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I'll try to answer them.",Ryzen 5 2600 running on MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi
Amd,They're charging 899€ which is roughly 1075USD. Yes sir over a thousand dollars for the 6800. [Link](https://www.alternate.be/GIGABYTE/Radeon-RX-6800-16G-grafische-kaart/html/product/1694767?lk=21528),Scalpernate (belgium) at it again with the 6800.
Amd,"So I am curious what everyone thinks about the match up between these two cards now that AIB prices are released. Given the fact that the price of most AIB 6800 XTs are at or higher than the RTX 3080s, is it even worth it to go for AMD this generation? I know that the 6000 series has made great leaps forward with raw rasterization performance, but given that they don't outright beat nvidia and the rtx cards offer DLSS and functuonal ray tracing, I have trouble seeing how one would go for a 6800 XT over a 3080. What do you think?",AIB Prices: 6800 XT vs RTX 3080

**TL:DR**

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

So hold off from buying an older ryzen processor which I thought I was gonna have to do.

Amd,"Disclaimer: sorry if this is a little ranty.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted. 

What are your opinions?

Amd,"I have been eyeing the PN50 (specifically the 4800U) ever since it was announced and been unable to find stock anywhere.  I have an aging BRIX that won't stay booted on me anymore and really wanted a Ryzen replacement. I'd seen a few PN50 videos here and there so I knew it was out there, but was still unable to find it available for purchase.

I happened across the SimplyNUC Aspen, which is just a PN50 barebones with some components installed to make it functional. I attempted to order from their website and while it appeared there was stock to purchase, I was having trouble getting the item into the cart.

The site has an online chat, so I connected with Greg who was very helpful.  I was looking for a 64GB 2TB unit but found that the 64GB was not 3200, so I bought the cheapest model (4GB, 128GB M.2) with the expectation to buy better stuff on Newegg.

He said very clearly and confidently that they would ship in 2 to 3 business days and that he could send me a link to complete the order.  I paid at the link and for ovenight shipping (on a Wednesday) and went to Newegg to buy my 64GB HyperX and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2.  

I received my memory on Friday and my M.2 on Saturday.  On the 3rd business day (Monday before Thanksgiving) I messaged again to make sure that I would be receiving my computer on Tuesday as I was leaving the country on Sunday and knew packages wouldn't arrive on turkey day.

Unfortunately, the rep Piper told me that none were in stock.  They had received stock, but not nearly enough for the outstanding orders and that I would not be receiving my product until sometime in December.  She suggested I reach out to Greg to find out why I was guaranteed one in 3 days.

I emailed Greg who was very apologetic and was going to get to the bottom of it.  I heard back saying that they only had the 4700U in stock and would happily send me that and refund the difference, but that the 4800U would not be in stock until the first week of December.  He also offered to cancel the order outright but since I had already spent 600 bucks on the memory and drive, I was not too excited about that idea.  I told him I'd sleep on it and let him know.

The next day I saw Gigabyte announce their new BRIX S with Ryzen 4800U so now I had a dilemma on my hands.  I loved my BRIX, but I really didn't want to get stuck in the same loop I did with the PN50 due to availability issues, so I decided to stick it out if I was ""guaranteed"" one in December.  I'd arrive back in the country before Christmas and was resolved to wait it out.

I emailed Greg and he said it was extremely likely it would come in the first or second week of December so I agreed to wait. 

On Thanksgiving day however, I received a very odd phone call from FedEx saying I had a package on the way and to be there Friday to sign for it.  I checked my email and saw that sure enough, SimplyNUC had sent me a fedex from their Austin offices on Thanksgiving day.  I crossed my fingers but did not want to get my hopes too high that my 4800U was in transit.

Friday about 10am I hear a knock on the door and lo and behold there is a box from SimplyNUC with a PN50 inside.  And after close inspection it was my beloved 4800U.  They managed to get me one before I left the country after all.  

I will say that through all of the communication with Greg and Piper, they were terrific to work with. They were very apologetic and wanting to work with me for the best possible outcome even if it wasn't my first choice outcome.   Thanks much to SimplyNUC for getting me my perfect system just in time for my travel.

Oh, and the PN50?  I'm very pleased with it so far.  It's so much faster and quieter than my BRIX, even setting the fans to performance mode.  I couldn't be happier.

I purchased a new Ryzen CPU on the launch date within the first two minutes. (I used multiple computers with the same account to get that small advantage in case one lagged). At the moment of purchase, I was given an ETA of about a week. Which I thought was very quick. 

Then upon checking daily on their website, I found out it date was changed to the week after.

Again, no big deal, there is a pandemic going on. I checked my email and received no correspondence (typical for PLE they expect that you check their website). 

So the date came around and I got ready to go pick it up, and just before leaving I checked their website and they had changed the date to the week after that, again in typical PLE fashion without email correspondence on the date.

Currently it has been 24 days after the launch and nearing a week after my last ETA, with no real reason as to why it took this long nor a reason why my 3 ETAs were not accurate. They promised thousands of units on launch day but I’m still unsure why I, as a customer, was treaded this badly. Am I overreacting and entitled?

There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

The Lenovo IdeaPad S540 is a very performative office laptop with all-round potential and a price tag of 750 Euro (~$900) despite the manufacturer cutting one or two corners along the way.

We were somewhat annoyed by the display: While it certainly isn't bad, it can't keep up with the results of last year's panel. Contrast and the black value, for example, have become less good and even the brightness distribution isn't what it was. Presumably, Lenovo wanted to save a little money with the new panel. 

Another thing Lenovo was a little stingy about is the SSD: Although again this isn't a bad model, the Western Digital SSD can't quite keep up with the Samsung PM981 SSD in the device's predecessor.

Both these changes do not make the new S540 a bad laptop and the alternative hardware still is fine. Plus, the new IdeaPad 540 now features a new AMD Ryzen processor that is really impressive. The Ryzen 5 4600U in this device is almost twice as fast as the Ryzen 5 3550H in the predecessor. The Intel Core i5-1035G7 cannot even pretend to keep up with AMD's CPU.

Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

TLDR: If you a buying a Threadripper for Animation/3D Rendering. Go with a bigger cooler (360mm) and you’ll get much better results under extreme heavy load.

Sadly, I wasn't lucky enough to get the reference model and decided to not buy from scalpers, I thought when the AIBs will release, I will get a Red Devil (that was my dream card for some time). So I ordered a 6800 XT Red Devil for about 1000€... insta regret. Seeing how they are not even available worldwide, I decided to cancel that order, because I won't be able to get it before Cyberpunk comes out for sure... after few days of thinking, I found a deal for Sapphire 5700 XT Nitro+ and bought it. And while I wnot be able to play the game in 4k60 ultra, as I first planned, I'm sure it will be enough for 1080p144 (I have 2 FreeSync screens). Maybe I will upgrade to RDNA 3 in the future, we will see. Just wanted to say, if the availability was there, I would be ready to overpay for new GPU.

No one seems to have a 5900X and emulate via RPCS3, so I'm asking a more theoretical question but would this be correct? I also re-read Digital Foundry's review on the 2 chips and in 1080p, the 5800X seems to overall perform better there.

I purchased a new Ryzen CPU on the launch date within the first two minutes. (I used multiple computers with the same account to get that small advantage in case one lagged). At the moment of purchase, I was given an ETA of about a week. Which I thought was very quick. 

Then upon checking daily on their website, I found out it date was changed to the week after.

Again, no big deal, there is a pandemic going on. I checked my email and received no correspondence (typical for PLE they expect that you check their website). 

So the date came around and I got ready to go pick it up, and just before leaving I checked their website and they had changed the date to the week after that, again in typical PLE fashion without email correspondence on the date.

Currently it has been 24 days after the launch and nearing a week after my last ETA, with no real reason as to why it took this long nor a reason why my 3 ETAs were not accurate. They promised thousands of units on launch day but I’m still unsure why I, as a customer, was treaded this badly. Am I overreacting and entitled? I mean I did spend a very large sum of money (for me) with them so :/

Without making identifying comments, this has happened to me before, for other products (that aren’t as popular), with PLE and their perpetual ETAs. I hope I get something at the end of this.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

Amd,"We have taken a look at the 13.3-inch subnotebook Lenovo IdeaPad S540. We were once again surprised by the currently outstanding performance of the Ryzen processors. Thanks to this, the laptop received a very good rating despite the manufacturer having cut a few cut corners.

The Lenovo IdeaPad S540 is a very performative office laptop with all-round potential and a price tag of 750 Euro (~$900) despite the manufacturer cutting one or two corners along the way.

We were somewhat annoyed by the display: While it certainly isn't bad, it can't keep up with the results of last year's panel. Contrast and the black value, for example, have become less good and even the brightness distribution isn't what it was. Presumably, Lenovo wanted to save a little money with the new panel. 

Another thing Lenovo was a little stingy about is the SSD: Although again this isn't a bad model, the Western Digital SSD can't quite keep up with the Samsung PM981 SSD in the device's predecessor.

Both these changes do not make the new S540 a bad laptop and the alternative hardware still is fine. Plus, the new IdeaPad 540 now features a new AMD Ryzen processor that is really impressive.

Amd,"I’m sure there’s a lot of you out there like myself with maybe a few friends that are really interested in PC but who are still on consoles. I’ve been telling a few poor souls to wait since like March for Ampere, RDNA 2, and Zen 3. At this point we all understand the supply issues and the extreme constraints that a global pandemic places on these companies. I don’t harbor any negative feelings towards either AMD or Nvidia, it’s just disappointing. I feel weird about recommending older GPUs right now. I don’t want my friends expectations to be let down in any way, especially when they are already spending 1k plus on their builds. Call me crazy but I think that spending  that much should get you an experience that is far superior to that of the series x/ ps5. Right now the only way to have a build that matches the consoles is to have some equivalent to the RTX 3070/RX 6800 or better.

Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!

**TL:DR**

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

So hold off from buying an older ryzen processor which I thought I was gonna have to do.

Amd,"Sorry that this question gets asked day after day, but I'm upgrading my CPU from an old 3570k and not sure what option to go for.

Ideally, I'd like a 3600 but it's either out of stock or far more expensive than it should be atm (unfortunately I can't really put off building much longer). I've considered the 2600x (~£140) and the 2700x (~£180), but the 3500x is a tempting option at the same price point as the 2600x.

I'm not an expert, so I'm unsure if the newer architecture of the 3500x is worth the 6 fewer threads than the 2600x. I'm also open to other suggestions :)

I don't think I'll be able to snag a 6800 or 6800 xt for anywhere near MSRP before January, and with 5700 xt's going out of stock, are they gone for good, or just a black friday rush on cards due to the pitiful stock of new ones?

Amd,"I think it is pretty clear that the debacle of the RDNA2 6000 series launch having been in orders of magnitude worse than Nvidia RTX 3000 series begs the question. I mean, it was (and is) so bad that AIBs have taken it upon themselves to directly dig even further the Rx 6000 series with insane prices of the AIB models and some retailers in Europe are straight up scalping these cards despite having no stocks. 

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro. So, in Germany you can get scalped with all the perks of buying directly from a retailer.

Amd,"Canadian CanadaComputers 5900x backorder status story.

&amp;#x200B;

I backordered the 5900x on release day at the Burnaby, BC, CanadaComputers location. While paying for the backorder deposit, I naturally asked the employees to check how many people are ahead of me in line for the 5900x. An separate employee that wasn't helping me at the cash register proudly shouted out 'FIVE! There's 5 backorders so far'. (Back orders are per store and not linked with online order or other stores).

So I was quite content being with #6. Thinking on the next resupply I'll have a high chance of getting one. Today I walked in to buy a motherboard and check on the backorder queue/status. Guy that assisted me checked my backorder position and said I am **TENTH** in line. Now, I immediately knew what shady shit happened. Even though employee says they must've just made a mistake or system broken. I am certain that some shady employees fixed the backorder positions up for their friends or family.

There's no way that guy that so proudly shouted out (when not even being asked directly since his not the one assisting me) the amount of backorders their store got on the 5900x is wrong. On top of that, the way this employee checked and then whimpering-ly told me ""You are 10th in line"". It just screams to me that his not the one fixing the backorder positions but he knows it's been fixed by someone and others have came checking their backorder positions and he had to tell them the same shit. Then having deal with the angry customer after. Now I knew there's nothing I could do about it, so I just expressed how fucked up that was with a few words and then left.

Somehow I wasn't too surprised, knowing even their store managers are scalping shit for themselves before anyone can even buy them.Some extra info he checked for me: (This is for Canada, BC)

There's 12 5900x in-transit to the Grandview CC store.

There's 8 5900x in-transit to the most of the rest of the CC stores. (Cool they just happen to have made me #10 in line huh)

Roughly 50 5900x in-transit to CC stores across BC. It will arrive in 1-2 weeks. Next batch zero ETA.

Amd,"Disclaimer: sorry if this is a little ranty.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted.

There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing.

Amd,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share that I've got a Ryzen 5 2600 up and running on an MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard. Here is a CPU-Z validation: [https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq](https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq)

I'm creating this post, because I couldn't find enough information, if the motherboard will work with my CPU. Officially, the CPU is not supported by the motherboard (and from the B550 Chipset in general), but I found some comments here on Reddit and other forums that it might work, so I decided to give it a try. Here is what I had to do however, in order to get everything up and running.

Initially, the motherboard didn't boot with the Ryzen 5 2600. I decided to try and update the BIOS with MSI's Flashback to the latest BIOS version 7C91v14. With the CPU still in the socket, the Flashback didn't work as well, although theoretically it should work even with an installed CPU. The red LED for the Flashback blinked multiple times and then stayed solid for over 10 minutes and the other lights on the motherboard didn't light up, which meant that the Flashback isn't working.

I had to remove absolutely everything (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU) from the motherboard and leave only the 8 PIN CPU power connector and the 24 PIN power connector. After the BIOS flash, I installed the CPU, RAM, GPU and SSD and the PC booted without any problems. Everything (PCI-E Gen 3 including NVMe, SATA, XMP Profiles, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) seems to be working fine for now. The CPU is also recognized in the BIOS correctly.

One small note about using the Flashback: The USB drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and an MBR scheme. The flash might not work, if the scheme is not MBR.

If you have any questions, please let me know. I'll try to answer them.",Ryzen 5 2600 running on MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi

Amd,"So I am curious what everyone thinks about the match up between these two cards now that AIB prices are released. Given the fact that the price of most AIB 6800 XTs are at or higher than the RTX 3080s, is it even worth it to go for AMD this generation? I know that the 6000 series has made great leaps forward with raw rasterization performance, but given that they don't outright beat nvidia and the rtx cards offer DLSS and functuonal ray tracing, I have trouble seeing how one would go for a 6800 XT over a 3080. What do you think?",AIB Prices: 6800 XT vs RTX 3080
Amd,"Hi all.

Simple question.

I received a **Ryzen 5 3400G** as a gift.

I already have a graphic card, a bit old but I'm thinking on an upgrade soon.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is:

Im not going to use the integrated graphics...so, **should I change it for a Ryzen 5 2600?**

It is worth it, or the difference is negligible?

Changing it is for **free**. Just a bit messy, paperwork, warranty...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda wondering if the 2600 would ""age better"" with 6 cores.

Amd,"I really really wanted to do an all AMD system, but after the last 10 days it became obvious to me that:

1. You have to be extremely lucky to get on retail
2. The AMD AIB pricing is ludicrous
3. It seems that the cards are going to rise in price

As a result, I decided that whichever I get first, be it a 3080 or a 6800Xt would be the card I get. If I hold out for AMD, whose launch also seems to be on tissue paper it could take me 6 months.

Funny thing is that I actually bought an EVGA FTW3 three weeks ago, but solid it because of all the horrible experiences people are having, and at the time I believed AMD and thought it would not be impossible to get a video card. Sold it at list price so I did not scalp. The guy who bought it (around 1 min after listing) was so happy and excited. It was cool. I don't regret selling it.

So I started scouring CL. I am in San Diego and there was a solid amount of ads. Some were from predatory scalpers, but those were easy to weed out. Most are well below the EBAY scalping level which I would never do but still really high. It seems a lot of people are getting preorders and EVGA queue orders in and had already found the card some other way. And several would negotiate. It's not a bad way to go with some effort but definitely some risk.

In the end I paid $970.

Seems expensive, but I noticed that BH has it at $799 but out of stock. And AMD has raised the price in their store to $849.

When I saw this it dawned on me that we might be entering another phase where all the GPUs sell for more than MSRP or original MSRP, and availability will remain ultra scarce. So my premium really wasn't all that much around $60-$70 considering tax.

Also the card is awesome. It is really really fast compared to my 1070 TI even with my i5-8400 processor (still waiting for some parts on my 5600X new PC though I have the processor. It is also DEAD silent even at load, and never got about 59 degrees in Time Spy (17556 graphics score so pretty decent)

I am just glad for it to be over. I wanted to support AMD but nothing about their launch is any more consumer positive than what what NVIDIA did.

If $849 is the new baseline, then considering tax and shipping I really did not pay much of a premium at all.",I gave up and went ASUS TUF 3080 OC
Amd,"I have been eyeing the PN50 (specifically the 4800U) ever since it was announced and been unable to find stock anywhere.  I have an aging BRIX that won't stay booted on me anymore and really wanted a Ryzen replacement. I'd seen a few PN50 videos here and there so I knew it was out there, but was still unable to find it available for purchase.

I happened across the SimplyNUC Aspen, which is just a PN50 barebones with some components installed to make it functional. I attempted to order from their website and while it appeared there was stock to purchase, I was having trouble getting the item into the cart.

The site has an online chat, so I connected with Greg who was very helpful.  I was looking for a 64GB 2TB unit but found that the 64GB was not 3200, so I bought the cheapest model (4GB, 128GB M.2) with the expectation to buy better stuff on Newegg.

He said very clearly and confidently that they would ship in 2 to 3 business days and that he could send me a link to complete the order.  I paid at the link and for ovenight shipping (on a Wednesday) and went to Newegg to buy my 64GB HyperX and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2.  

I received my memory on Friday and my M.2 on Saturday.  On the 3rd business day (Monday before Thanksgiving) I messaged again to make sure that I would be receiving my computer on Tuesday as I was leaving the country on Sunday and knew packages wouldn't arrive on turkey day.

Unfortunately, the rep Piper told me that none were in stock.  They had received stock, but not nearly enough for the outstanding orders and that I would not be receiving my product until sometime in December.  She suggested I reach out to Greg to find out why I was guaranteed one in 3 days.

I emailed Greg who was very apologetic and was going to get to the bottom of it.  I heard back saying that they only had the 4700U in stock and would happily send me that and refund the difference, but that the 4800U would not be in stock until the first week of December.  He also offered to cancel the order outright but since I had already spent 600 bucks on the memory and drive, I was not too excited about that idea.  I told him I'd sleep on it and let him know.

The next day I saw Gigabyte announce their new BRIX S with Ryzen 4800U so now I had a dilemma on my hands.  I loved my BRIX, but I really didn't want to get stuck in the same loop I did with the PN50 due to availability issues, so I decided to stick it out if I was ""guaranteed"" one in December.  I'd arrive back in the country before Christmas and was resolved to wait it out.

I emailed Greg and he said it was extremely likely it would come in the first or second week of December so I agreed to wait. 

On Thanksgiving day however, I received a very odd phone call from FedEx saying I had a package on the way and to be there Friday to sign for it.  I checked my email and saw that sure enough, SimplyNUC had sent me a fedex from their Austin offices on Thanksgiving day.  I crossed my fingers but did not want to get my hopes too high that my 4800U was in transit.

Friday about 10am I hear a knock on the door and lo and behold there is a box from SimplyNUC with a PN50 inside.  And after close inspection it was my beloved 4800U.  They managed to get me one before I left the country after all.  

I will say that through all of the communication with Greg and Piper, they were terrific to work with. They were very apologetic and wanting to work with me for the best possible outcome even if it wasn't my first choice outcome.   Thanks much to SimplyNUC for getting me my perfect system just in time for my travel.

Oh, and the PN50?  I'm very pleased with it so far.  It's so much faster and quieter than my BRIX, even setting the fans to performance mode.  I couldn't be happier.

TLDR: rocky start but got me what I needed just a few days late. Very happy with their people.",My experience with SimplyNUC (Purchase of Asus PN50)
Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

TLDR: If you a buying a Threadripper for Animation/3D Rendering. Go with a bigger cooler (360mm) and you’ll get much better results under extreme heavy load.

On my monitor, an LG 34GN850 (supposedly a 10bit panel), I notice a few things after enabling the setting. It definitely interferes with Freesync. I don't see the refresh rate change with framerate; Freesync is still being detected as on though. 

However, I'm unable to see any tearing....anywhere. Vysnc on or off, doesn't matter, no tearing. Does it enable and enforce some kind of buffering at the driver level? 

I want to say that I notice a bit more color depth but it's hard to say. Something does seem better or at the very least different but it could just be in my head. I feel like motion seems a bit clearer but 'jumpy'. The best way I can find to describe it is that it feels like looking at a really fast flip-book but when disabled Freesync adds blur between frames and thus seems smoother but a tad bid muddier.

When comparing to it off, motion does seem blurrier. Regardless of whether Freesync is on or off in the driver or the monitor. Likewise with Vsync. And as expected, tearing comes back with all three settings off.

I've had a Ryzen 5 2600x in my system for a while now with the stock Wraith Spire cooler.

I recently bought a high airflow case and noticed the fan was whining even at idle.

Just yesterday I decided to check the temps and fan speeds with HWInfo and while the temperature was 40c at idle, the fan was at ~2400 rpm.

I rebooted into the (latest) BIOS of my MSI B450 Pro Carbon AC (non MAX) and saw the default configuration began at 55% fan speed.

More specifically, it was set as 55% speed up to 35c,  70% speed above 50c and 100% fan speed over 60c.

That's absurdly high for no reason at all.
I immediately changed it to:

 20% @ 40c

45% @ 50c

65% @ 60c

100% @ 75c

Booted into windows and lo and behold it's MUCH quieter now at idle and light use.

Min/Max/Avg is all  arround 60-61, which is insanly high, but my CCD2 runs between 38 and 40  degrees. Now I dont want to destroy anything and working/writing from  my old PC again.

My System:

Ryzen 5900x  
Asus Crosshair Viii Hero  
Asus Rog Strix RTX 3090  
NZXT Kraken X73  
LianLi 011 xl with 13 fan setup (push-pull radiator) 10x corsair QL + 3x Kraken fans  
G.Skill Neo 3600 CL 14 Ram

I  hope some of you have any ideas for me, because for me with the big  idle temp difference from CCD1 and CCD2 it seems like a broken CPU - bad  silicon or whatever, but maybe/hopefuly I am wrong and could get some  help from you guys.

Thanks in advance for any comment,

To set it up I connected another DP cable directly between RX 6800 and monitor.

Then I selected USB-C video out as main monitor and disabled DP output.

Then I switched monitor to the only active input.

So far so good. It works very nicely and mouse, keyboard and monitor work correctly. There is an issue with my USB audio driver having static noise after a few minutes but that's another issue.


The main problem however is that I am not able to restart my computer with just USB-C connected. The display stays black, USB devices however work correctly.

* Crosshair VIII Hero

* Kraken Z73 w/ QL120 pegged at 100%

Originally, I went into the BIOS, turned on PBO and just went about my business. Recently, an NZXT cam update came out allowing me to monitor Zen 3 temps on my AIO LCD, and I noticed I was hitting high 80s while gaming. This seemed quite high, so I went and turned off ""Core Performance Boost"" as well as PBO in the bios and my gaming loads went to rarely breaking 60C.

Then I get the latest beta of MSI afterburner finally allowing me to monitor CPU while gaming. So I do some gaming and I realize that the CPU is pegged at 3400 mhz, so no boosting at all. I went and turned ""Core Performance Boost"" back to Auto, and now I'm boosting up to 4.9 ghz, but my temps are hitting 80C at times. It's worth noting that Ryzen master always reports a temperature that's anywhere from 0-9C lower than the temps reported by Afterburner and NZXT Cam. Pretty sure this is package vs core temp.

Should a 5950X with stock boosting be hitting 80C on a 360 AIO with fans (I know QL120 are crappy for rads) pegged at max? A few of my fellow 5950X owners are saying they have PBO turned on and are in the 60s while gaming?!",What are normal 5950X temps?

Build details here: [https://pcpartpicker.com/b/MY8MnQ](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/MY8MnQ)

I run a 1080Ti for my GPU while gaming at 4K, and I didn't realize how much my 3770k was bottlenecking my GPU. Sounds kind of funny to hear in retrospect but I think I was losing about 10-20% fps. Anyway, I did notice that running benchmarks like CB R20 and Prime95 would toast the 5800X up to 83C even on my NH-D15S with its A15 and 4x A12x25s blowing full blast.

However the temperature is only a problem for multithreaded applications. Gaming is still mostly single threaded and even with EcoMode turned on, there was very little degredation to CB20 single thread and gaming fps (SoTTR and Witcher3, mainly GPU bound in 4K anyway).

So here's my workaround to the high temperatures:

* Enable ECO mode 65W
* \+200 AutoOC
* Dynamic undervolt (I have mine set to -0.1V)

I'm sure curve optimizer would help out even more but right now the F11i bios from gigabyte is very buggy and I cannot re-enter the bios once I flash it. With these settings, HWInfo would report max temperature of 60C while gaming and fans are silent. While multithreaded benchmarks do suffer, in practice, I can still have multiple browser tabs, discord, telegram, youtube, etc. while gaming and cannot perceive any degradation. 

Overall I am very happy with this setup now that I have tweaked it to my liking. I can still get the maximum frames from my GPU while the system is quiet and drawing minimal power. I also undervolt my GPU and still get 50-60+ fps in 4K games. Hope my experience will help you guys on the fence or hesitant about getting a 5800X.",5800X temperature workaround for gaming

Amd,"If you find one such scalper among many who is trying to use  the low supply situation to their advantage, should you try to shame them out of scalping? Sure! Share your thoughts. Speak your mind. It is a free country after all.

However, you have to understand that low supply and high demand means high prices. Just because a person is willing to pay an exorbitant amount for an item, that does not give you the rights to intervene or steal. Just imagine yourself as:

- A customer trying too win an auction. He needs a nvidia graphic for his computer ASAP.  However, he doesn't end up getting any graphic because of fake bids.

- A seller driving 1 hour to meet a craigslist buyer. Wait another 30 minutes for the guy to show up. Turns out he was never interested in buying.

- A seller receiving a charge back from fraudulent buyer and is now at risk the risk of losing $1500.

Like I get the frustration. I really do since I've been waiting for months to buy. But please do not go full SJW mode. What happens when these tactics become common against anyone who is trying to sell their old computer parts?

* 40 CUs;
* 12GB GDDR6;
* 192-bit;
* 64mb of Infinity Cache (versus 128mb on the 6800s);
* TGP of 186 to 211 watts;

Also, let's not forget about the 54% performance-per-watt promised by AMD over RDNA1.  


Overall these figures look like substantial cut-downs if compared to the RX 6800, particularly when it comes to CUs, memory bus and Infinity Cache. Now the RX 6800 is believed by many not to be a direct competitor against the RTX 3070, as it's price and performance are almost one-tier above (likely comparable to an eventual 3070 ""Super""). Therefore some (myself included) believe the 6700XT to be the actual answer against the 3070. But these specs seem much lower than what they would need to be to compete against the 3070 (which is on average 10-13% slower than the 6800).

Amd,"On the Radeon RX6800 you can configure a ""Max frequency"" or overclock but also a ""Min frequency"". If you cap your framerate to stay within the freesync range of your monitor, you will still have framedrops here in there.

For example:

You cap your framerate at 142fps to stay within 30-144hz range of your monitor. And you know your GPU can handle it because without the cap it goes to 180+fps minimum. But still you notice framedrops when capped to 120-130fps.

This is because by limiting the framerate, your GPU is no longer operating at 99-100% load and it will downclock. Once it's downclocked it's harder for the GPU to handle certain spikes in workload. 

But, if you increase your minimum frequency at 100Mhz lower then maximum frequency, you will notice that GPU usage will increase again and that the frequency is constantly between the minimum and maximum frequency. This will avoid any framedrops you might have while capping your framerate on stock GPU settings or OC settings.

This might be commen knowledge by many, but I notice on our community discord that it's a common mistake to just cap the framerate and expect the GPU to stay at that framerate 100% of the time.","Make sure to increase your ""Min frequency"" to ""Max frequency"" -100 for stable framecap on Radeon RX6800"

Amd,"There is a lot going on...
In my humble opinion the 3000 and 5000 series are not really good in price performance.
I'm currently using a 115€ Ryzen 5 1600AF which is probably still wort 100€-110€.

Heres why:
There are no better alternatives.

The Ryzen 5 2600(X) is on pair with it.

The Ryzen 5 3600 is like 8% faster, but often costs 50€ more, which is a really bad upgrade in perfomance for the money (this would be okay for high end, but in mid range it should be way more linear).

The Ryzen 5 3500X is 150€ too, no alternative there I guess?

I bought myself a b550 Mainboard and wanted to upgrade my ""old"" 1600AF.
Wanted to sell it for 100-110€(i know this is the price I bought it for, but there's no better alternative out there and people still sell for this price).

Am I overseeing some options... ?
Why is it so ""broken""?
A Ryzen 5 5600X with 20% more perfomance than a 5 3600X cost 2x as much? 20% more perfomance for 200% more money?

The used market seems to have high demand but low offer? Do you agree? 
Where does this come from? 

Would you upgrade in my situation, and to which CPU?

Why do I want to upgrade? 

I want slightly better perfomance, a better bang for my bucks.
Playing BF5 mainly... Want to do something about 1%/0.1% lows, suffering from lag spikes...

Amd,"Hi,

Many of us stopped using DDU because AMD has implemented this feature in the driver installer + the option to restore previously saved settings. This saves a lot of time and I've personally never used DDU anymore since the feature exists without issues. 

Now, the AMD driver does work as intended but by restoring previous settings, the game profiles get restored aswell. But this can cause driver instability in certain games when you try to open the AMD sidepanel or when you try to enter the driver settings while a game is launched.

I don't know why but it seems that the game profile contains more info than what is visible to the user and certain settings, originally created for your old AMD GPU cause a misconfiguration for a new Radeon 6800.

The fix is easy. If you notice that the driver crashes in a certain game when you want to enter the driver settings, or you notice instability in general, simply delete that game profile, click on ""refresh"" so that the driver creates a new one, and you can reconfigure your preferences in the new game profile. Even when you configure the exact same game profile settings, the driver will no longer crash when you try to open it while gaming.

This does show that using DDU or not using ""Restore previous settings"" is still the best way to make sure everything is 100% stable. Because if this happened with this launch, you can be fairly sure that this happened before. And I understand 100% that people that upgrade from AMD to AMD want to restore their previous settings in order to avoid regonfiguring everything.","New Radeon 6800/6800XT upgraders, recreate your game profiles!"

1. Upgraded to kernel 5.10 RC5
2. Obaif PPA to get Mesa 2.3 DEVEL
3. Installed LLVM 11.

I have also tried the same cycle with Ubuntu 20.10

Sometimes ive done a cycle from above, the computer is hesitating to boot.

I originally had a 600w PSU, and thought i could be to small, so ordered a 1200w PSU, just to rule out this scenario.

Amd,"ASRock Rack has unveiled its latest small form factor motherboard designed for AMD's EYPC processors, the ROMED4ID-2T. It is based on a new proprietary form factor similar to Mini-ITX, affectionally colloquialized as 'Deep' Mini-ITX, which is slightly larger than standard mini-ITX. The board supports for EPYC Rome 7002 processors up to 64 cores.

Being able to amalgamate up to 64 cores with a mini-ITX motherboard isn't a small feat; the ROMED4ID-2T does it for users looking to build a server with a small overall footprint. This model opts for a new wider proprietary design, the 'deep mini-ITX' form factor with dimensions of 6.7 x 8.2 inches, rather than 6.7-inch square for regular mini-ITX.

The main obvious limitation with such a small motherboard size and a large socket is that not all of the features of the processor is made available - there are some sacrifices to put it all in. That starts with the memory support, with this model only having four memory slots, and therefore four memory channels, rather than the standard eight channels that EPYC Rome can provide. The other is PCIe 4.0 support - there is one PCIe 4.0 x16 full length slot, and six Slimline PCIe 4.0 x8 ports, but that is still far fewer than the 128 lanes this CPU can provide. 

For storage devices, other than the single M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 slot, there is plenty to accommodate multiple drives, despite the size limitations, with up to sixteen SATA ports support from two of the Slimline ports, which ASRock states can be configured within the BIOS. This also includes support for bulk U.2 storage, with two Slimline ports operating at PCIe 4.0 x8 or eight SATA ports, and the other four Slimline simply listed as being PCIe 4.0 x8 only.

Being primarily marketed as a server-focused model, it includes many of the usual suspects regarding internal headers, including one for IPMB, PMBus, and a 13-pin LPC TPM header. There are also three 4-pin fan headers, each with its own fan fail LED.

Regarding connectivity, the ASRock Rack ROMED4ID-2T includes an Intel X550-AT2 10 Gb controller, which adds two 10 GbE ports on the rear panel, as well as a dedicated Realtek RTL8211E Ethernet port for the board's IPMI. A single DB15 D-Sub video output is present for users looking to access the system physically over the IPMI, with a UID LED button and a pair of USB 3.2 G1 Type-A ports.

At present, ASRock hasn't given any information regarding pricing or availability, but we expect to hear something shortly.",AMD EPYC Rome in (Deep) Mini-ITX? ASRock Rack's New ROMED4ID-2T

How is your R9 doing regarding temps?  
I've got the Liquid Freezer II 360 top mounted, and while it runs ""normally"" in benchmarks (around 65-70 in cinebench), it seems weirdly overloaded in trivial tasks such as downloading a game or when windows decides to do something minor in the background, sometimes when extracting a zip.  
This is when the temps spike up to 70c within seconds and my radiator fans spin up to 80-100%.

I fill out an online contact form asking them to ship one out with my order. They reply and say ""no, we don't ship out shelf items to online orders"".  I was going to also order a 3080 card once they became available. Oh well, cancelled the entire shipment and went with newegg.

Amd,"Ordered this last week from Newegg while I'm waiting for the 5950x I back-ordered from B&amp;H.  I love it so far.  The single core bursts up to 4.825 out of the box with a 611 score on Cinebench R20.  

I know the 5600x is a much better value, but man I couldn't be more pleased with the way its running games.  

I really only play older games but here are two examples:

Diablo 3 went from 60-70 fps at 1440P to 200-240FPS at 4K

The Total War Shogun benchmark was at 54FPS at 1080P Now it's at 190FPS.  

This thing pairs very well  with a 3080.   It's much better than the 2500K with an R9 Fury I had before.  :)

Summary:  I would recommend this if you want to game and don't mind spending the extra $150 on two more cores.

Amd,"My 5600X came in the mail earlier this week and immediately I noticed my benchmarks aren't what they should be. My all-core CBR20 score was barely above my stock 3600, and even with highly tuned PBO I'm still below 4000. All-core boost only reached base clock at stock, just below 4ghz with PBO. Single core scores are better but still disappointing.

I remembered that Optimum Tech had similar issues, detailed in this video [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xFaCVOFST0). It's worth noting that both my and his issues are on X570 Mini ITX boards (from two different manufacturers), but after some searching it seems like a fair number of people are having the same issue on both B550 and X570 boards of all form factors. Hard to tell what the issue is exactly, but hopefully upcoming BIOS updates will fix the issue.

If you're looking to buy a Ryzen 5000 series processor, it may be worth searching to see if other people with your motherboard are having any such issues. There's no way of knowing if/when BIOS updates will fix the problem but hopefully they will soon. I have hope that PBO2 will at least help mitigate the issue next month.

The whole time I have been pissed at those bastards, but ultimately little to nothing is being done to stop them. Scalpers are simply taking advantage of the lack of measures in place to validate a human vs bot purchase.

My anger is now redirected at retailers and AMD. Why? Initially I thought, if I was the owner of Newegg, or any retailer, my end goal is a sale. I put something on the market and someone buys it, plain and simple, regardless of who is making the purchase. But after some thought I find myself more pissed at retailers. If scalpers were removed from the equation these processors, and GPUs,  would still sell out completely. With that said, if you are the owner of Newegg, wouldn't you want your sale to go to your PC building buyers to keep them happy instead of scalpers? The sale will still happen, it is a matter of who you want to keep satisfied with the transaction.

Sorry about the rant, I am just extremely disappointed and can't believe more is not being done. Whether Ryzen was a paper launch, or Big Navi, at the end of the day retailers have treated us like second class citizens. I think we need to rally against them to do something about the scalpers.

*Note: The following information is compiled from successful experiences from the [pcbuildhelper community](https://discord.gg/yUAk993)*

## How to be successful in buying a [insert cpu/gpu]

## Part 1:

Know exactly what you’re looking for and stick to it. I know it’s frustrating not being able to get ANY card/cpu. But make sure you’re actually willing to settle for that non FE card or 5800X, or else you’ll end up with buyers remorse and go through the hassle of trying to trade it (no ones going to really be trading down right now).

## Part 2:

Pick the stores you want or are willing to buy from, and make sure you know their practices. There are some stores out there that will take preorders for days and not even have any indication when they will get any stock

*Note: I’m in the US and this list is mainly for this region.*

**Stores to follow**

* [https://bestbuy.com](https://bestbuy.com) \- the rarest( \~once a week) to drop of them all, but when they drop they drop big. And IMO their RNG button queue is the best anti bot (almost anti-human) system.
* [https://amazon.com](https://amazon.com) \- they like to do pre-orders, and even though the dates seem far, they will always get pushed up and orders will come to those “first in line”
* [https://newegg.com](https://newegg.com) \- has been the best with massive drops, albeit mostly bundles. But you can always return/sell/trade the bundled item.

For newegg, use apple pay and the app, it's the fastest

For amazon, setup the one click option in your account settings

**Stores with some luck**

* [https://adorama.com](https://adorama.com)
* [https://provantage.com](https://provantage.com)
* [https://walmart.com](https://walmart.com) (surprisingly)

**Stores to avoid (usually)**

These are stores that have pre-orders that don’t have much transparency in regards to when fulfillment will actually happen (I’ve been waiting for a camera from BH for over 3 months..)

* [https://bhphotovideo.com](https://bhphotovideo.com])
* [https://shopblt.com](https://shopblt.com])

**Local Shops**

These tend to be in-person only so you have better chances since there are no bots, but depending on your location these may not exist

* microcenter
* central computers

## Part 3:

We all have lives to live and F5ing in front of our screen is not always the best option. There are several ways to get notifications, with some being more hands off than others

*Disclaimer: I built pcbuildhelper.com as a personal project, and have opened it to the world as a free service/site/discord alert bot*

_Note: there are other discords that are behind a paywall.. **DO NOT PAY OR SUPPORT ANY** a collection of the free servers are just as good if not better, and the paid ones tend to include scalpers._

**Streams**

I would suggest streams but tbh the linking system and the amount of data used is not ideal. You’re better off in a discord.

**Distill**

It's simply a chrome refresh extension with some change rules. One of the better local solutions IMO if you're looking for specific products and have the data and time.

*Note: It can eat a lot of data, and depending on the sites you're looking at you can get IP banned*

There’s a lot of guides out there such as [https://hackintosher.com/blog/get-hands-coffee-lake-cpu/](https://hackintosher.com/blog/get-hands-coffee-lake-cpu/)

You can just google “how to use distill to get XYZ”.

So there’s no need for me to regurgitate that information.

**Running (or even making) your own tracker**

If you’re really inclined you can use various open source projects to either use out of the box or as a basis for your own tracker

**Out of the box**

* Streetmerchant (prev nvidia-snatcher) - [https://github.com/jef/streetmerchant](https://github.com/jef/streetmerchant)
* Hari’s nvidia-bot - [https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/nvidia-bot](https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/nvidia-bot)

**Libraries/Frameworks**

* Puppeteer (nodejs) - [https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
* Scrapy (python) - [https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy)

Join their respective discords if you’re looking to go down this route for help!

## Final thoughts

Again I know how frustrating it can be in today's scalper/botting world. Stores/brands should ideally be the ones fixing this (shout out to EVGA for having a nice queue list, and Bestbuy for their queue button), but this is the best I can think of to help combat it in our own way. Let's hope more stock comes in, and let's get some dubs.

If you have any more suggestions on sites, or techniques please let me know in the comments! or chat with me in our discord ([https://discord.gg/yUAk993](https://discord.gg/yUAk993))

That doesn't mean that Frank Azor should have been taking shots at Nvidia for having no cards at launch, when the same situation happened for AMD. But to truly evaluate the launches of the cards, and which is a paper launch and which isn't, we shouldn't be yelling at AMD, and calling them evil 2 weeks after their launch, and we have to wait and see, since they have only had 2 weeks, versus 2 months for nvidia.

Yesterday, was apparently an embargo, not even a release date. So, I'm just telling everyone on this subreddit, and hell, if this explodes or something, people who are going to read this, please be patient. Only two weeks have passed. I get that this is a sucky year, to say the least, but these cards will come back in stock, whether that be Nvidia or AMD. We just need to wait until they do.

For the people who'll say I'm an AMD fanboy, I'm not. I don't even have a AMD graphics card, because of it not being available. But what I am saying is just... Wait. I am just as frustrated, believe me, with the lack of stock on any major retailer, because at around 9 AM, I was looking through Newegg, looking through everything, F5ing, only to get nothing. Then I went through B&amp;H, but they weren't selling anything, I went to best buy, online, then literally going to eBay to negotiate pricing from scalpers, before just giving up  But I was also looking, at 9 AM, for 3080s, on September 17th, looking through Best Buy, Newegg, B&amp;H, and eventually going across my state to go to a Microcenter, only to find it out of stock, and going back with nothing to show for it. Same thing happened with the 3070 on October 29th, because I thought there was more stock. But there wasn't. But I knew, that I had to wait, if I could get the card.

All we can do is wait. Wait and see. There are a whole slew of other problems with the pricing of AIBs, but I'm not going to get into that, since I'm not exactly like MLID, NAAF, or HU, where they have direct access to AIBs, and even companies and corporations. What I can say, as someone who's traveled across Virginia just to get a fucking graphics card, and coming back with nothing, we have to wait. We can't call AMD having a paper launch, or a post it note launch, without waiting. So... Let's wait together.

But, let me ask you, what do you think?","Here's my opinion about the launch, and it is controversial..."
Amd,"Hi there :) New on reddit and also making my coming back to PC gaming ! I have lost over 11 years of computer generations, be kind please :) 

First of all my build:

My question:

I know that I'm not going to have my hands on a 6800XT for maybe 3 months +? At an affordable price ! And I was wondering what video card I could temporally replace and resell afterwards when I can get my hands on these cards :) !

In the range between 200-250€ ! With less bottleneck as possible (yeah I learned that word on reddit, while reading, informing myself, youtube...)

My goal? With the 6800XT 1440p with full fps :) that the games looks beautifull and have perfect performance ! And maybe, playing chill 4k games like horizon zero dawn on the couch :)! 

The replacing card, I would be happy if I can get 60fps on 1440p but if I must downgrade to 1080p it will not bother me that much... Coming from an VERY old PC (maybe less than 720p xD) with an old TV screen...

Amd,"That's zero fucks, for those playing along at home.

**TL;DR:** There is no incentive for AMD and NVIDIA to try and improve customer sentiment right now.

We've talked a lot about Economics 101 on these subreddits over the last several months. Let's pivot and look at customer sentiment for a minute. Usually companies consider positive customer sentiment (which can be measured by things like net promoter score) beneficial to revenue.

But this matters a lot more in some markets than others. For example, having a strong net promoter score matters **a lot** to a high-end restaurant competing with 15 others in a busy city centre. Consistently high Yelp/Zagat/Google reviews are going to ensure the restaurant attracts diners, while a 2.4 out of 5 with comments about poor customer service, flies in the soup and so on will hurt financial viability over time.

AMD and NVIDIA are a duopoly in the PC GPU space. This is better for consumers than a monopoly - see e.g. RTX 2080 Ti price/perf when there was no high-end rival product - but it's still not very competitive.

When supply chain issues (COVID-19) and massive pent-up demand (also COVID-19) result in every GPU the manufacturer can get to market selling out in less than 30 seconds, there is absolutely no incentive for them to pay attention to Reddit and YouTube complaints about anti-consumer behaviours and bait advertising with fake launch MSRPs. The AMD and NVIDIA GPU divisions could have net promoter scores of 2-3 out of 10 and no one at head office would give a single fuck as long as the GPUs keep flying off the shelves.

It's worth noting that at the AIB level there is still an incentive to provide good customer service. I can count at least 12 AIB manufacturers just based on brands I'm aware of, and competition in that space is pretty fierce. This is why you see companies like EVGA try to differentiate themselves with pro-consumer warranty/return policies for example.

As a consumer, there is nothing you can do about AMD and NVIDIA's anti-consumer practices and pricing except to not buy their products. Because if 6800XTs keep flying off the shelves at 25% mark-ups over MSRP and there isn't a single 3070 or 3080 to be found anywhere, that's sending the GPU duopoly strong signals that they should keep doing what they're doing.",Reality check: AMD and NVIDIA give exactly as many fucks about Reddit's unhappiness at GPU pricing as the number of 6800XTs and RTX 3080s currently in stock...
Amd,"First a big thanks to this guy for selling his 6800 for the price of €600:[https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/k1djzr/grabbed\_an\_rx6800\_on\_launch\_but\_have\_decided\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/k1djzr/grabbed_an_rx6800_on_launch_but_have_decided_not/)Yes, there are still good people in the world :)

**Looks:**

Looks and feels like a premium product. Best reference design ever from AMG if you ask me.

**Noise:**

Most silent AMD card i've had in years. My Vega 56 sounded like a plane lifting off when I overclocked it to Vega 64 performance. My radeon VII also required a custom fan profile to keep clocks high but at much lower noiselevels and this card is superquite compared to those two. I did end up using a custom fan profile on the 6800, not because it was needed but just because I felt like 97°C hotspot temperature was a bit to high for my liking ( sidepanel case was open ) I have to keep in mind that during summertime my ambient room temperatur is about 1-2°C higher. Combine that with a little dust and you can easely expect higher GPU temperatures in the summer.

**Undervolt/overclock:**

Undervolting and overclocking this card is easy. It's really hard to ""crash"" the card. Every time it becomes unstable you just notice lower performance, but I wasn't able to crash the card at all. At some point the driver did crash but instantly rebooted and kept on working just fine. The reviewers that overclocked the card at 100% fanspeed are simply \*\*\*\*\*\* in the head. Nobody will actually want the fans to spin that loud unless your PC is in another room.

\- Core: 2400Mhz @ 880mv ( will result in clocks between 2230-2340 while gaming )

\- Memory: 2150Mhz + ""Fast"" memory timings preset ( will result in 2138-2140mhz while gaming )

\- Powerlimit: 15%

\- Fan profile: 25% - 50% - 60% - 65% - 75%  ( max )

These settings resulted in a furmark increase from 13635 points to 15577 points on 1080p:[https://gpuscore.top/furmark/show.php?id=212676](https://gpuscore.top/furmark/show.php?id=212676)

That's means in theory, in the best possible scenario I would have 14% performance gain with this overclock. In reality I'll be lucky to get half of that in games offcourse.

**Power &amp; temperature:**

Despite the undervolt, the increased powerlimit combined with the core and memory overclock did result in an uplift from 204WATT to 235WATT during furmark benchmarking.

With my custom settings, the temperature during full load didn't increase at all and remained at 66°C but the hotspot temperature did increase from 89° to 93°. For those of you who wonder why the stock hotspot temperature was that high, well, I always stresstest the card for 20min with my sidepanel open before I run the benchmark so that the card is nice and warm when I start it. Benchmarks in perfect conditions are useless anyway.

\---

That was it really. Summary. It's faster, more silent, cooler, less power consuming than my Radeon VII. And as a Battlefield 1 gamers, I couldn't be happyer since this card is a beast in frostbite engine. I will update this thread if needed if I notice that for some reasons the overclock settings turn out to be unstable in certain games. I play BF1, No Mans's sky, &amp; Microsoft Flight sim. So I should notice something in the next week.

Amd,"Checking ebay right now... the prices of 5800x are basically converged with MSRP at $449.. many listings ending near or even under the MSRP price +/- 10%. I don't even know if the resellers will let the sales go through at this point because if they bought retail from a newegg or best buy they would be losing money on these sales after ebay commissions.

The 5600x are a bit higher averaging around $50-100 over MSRP but still much more reasonable than double.

I think many of you saw that the retailer Antonline actually had 5800x in-stock and available for nearly 48 hours and many had their orders immediately shipped and confirmed. Keep in mind also that ebay takes a 10% cut of sales and there are potentially additional fees at the paypal or payment processor level that makes 5600x and 5800x basically unprofitable for scalpers now, meaning they will be taken out of the market from direct retailer buys.

This, compounded with the rumored ""additional large shipments"" that retailers will be getting from now until the end of the month should be encouraging for those in the market for one of these chips. If you don't feel super strongly about buying from scalpers (whether from a moral or warranty / returnability perspective), you can basically get any of these two cards with a minimal markup right now on ebay (maybe even cheaper if you have ebay bucks or other coupons saved / stacked).

Unfortunately the 5900x and 5950x are still selling at nearly a 50% premium on ebay so they are still scarce and profitable for the scalpers to bot. But for everyone else, particularly those only in the market for a gaming CPU I think the trends are positive that you won't have to wait until next year for a chip =)",Encouraging signs for 5600x and 5800x stock
Amd,"There have been some whispers through the grapevine in many internet communities about a sad, wrong, and mean practice that I can only describe as pure evil. Folks, today I learned that there are people out there that use software tools to *derail* eBay listings for scalped graphics cards. Yes, that's right... people are using software to give themselves an unfair advantage in the exchange of PC hardware from manufacturers to consumers! WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING!?  For example, [see this well-known, already completed, eBay auction](https://www.ebay.com/bfl/viewbids/174530868878) from days ago. Evil cyber criminals decimated this totally innocent and honest listing with dozens of fake bids. They bidded so rapidly, the lister couldn't even [cancel them](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/cancelling-bid?id=4140) all - So sad!

Doing this isn't a good idea because it could get your account banned from eBay... unless you were to use, say, a [VPN service](https://www.cnet.com/news/best-vpn-service-for-2020-expressvpn-surfshark-nordvpn-and-more/) to make a bunch of throwaway eBay accounts and stockpile their logins in a spreadsheet or something haha... IDK... or maybe everyone in the bid history is safe as long as the upper-most bid is fake? I don't entirely know how this dark underbelly criminal enterprise works, I'm just here to get the word out. So very shocking, all of this.

Again, do NOT do this. Scalpers are providing a *valuable service* to the PC gaming community when they pay $5 for bot scripts that snap up entire shipments of hardware from etailers and then automatically create auctions on other websites, pulling a 10x turnaround before the hardware even hits the first warehouse's shelves. It would be wrong to use bot scripts to deprive them of their right to trade graphics cards - **just put yourselves in their shoes**. They would *never* use technology maliciously to deprive *you* of a graphics card trade, would they? No. Never.

Also - do not [create](https://www.fullstackpython.com/bots.html), [share](https://github.com/), and use bot scripts or other software tools designed to derail these auctions with said throwaway eBay accounts (fully automated, or machine-assisted via URL scraping, doesn't matter). It's simply a very immoral and reprehensible thing to do. This should go without saying, but it's also very wrong to create and share public anti-scalper Telegram channels and Discord servers with the sole purpose of sharing eBay listings with each other for you, or your bid-bombing bots, to... well... bid-bomb. Very bad - do not do.

Again - Please do not do any of these things. They will only get the account, and its hundreds (possibly thousands, if you bot) of dirty bids, banned from eBay (unless, again, the account merely drove up the bid price but wasn't the winner of the auction - they'd just be able to claim ""Oh, I bought something else because I didn't win. If only you had told me 5 minutes sooner. Darn!"").

Just imagining the *distraught and panicked* look on this poor scalper's face when they're forced to stay up late into the night doing *real, actual work*, cancelling bids for hours on end as new stock trickles back onto the shelf should be enough to motivate you to not do it. They'd miss out on so many interactions with their loving friends and family that definitely exist. It just breaks my heart! What kind of *awful* person would use bot software to turn the tides of online sales in their own favor and deprive PC users of hardware? So very sad... to think, with each passing week, the shelf price falls further and further below what the scalpers paid on launch day... sometimes to the point that they might begin to wonder if their main source of income being ""owning someone else's graphics cards"" was a smart long-term idea...

So, anyways... thanks for reading.","The moderators of /r/AMD do NOT condone locating scalper auctions, leaving dozens of absurd bids, so as to repeatedly derail a scalper's opportunity to make a sale and ultimately de-incentivize PC hardware scalping."

The 3400G would not go over 2800 MHz reliably.  (That includes 5+ hours of bootable MemTest64).  Since I haven't OC'd RAM or CPU for 7 years, I just used the DOCP values of 16 19 19 39, at 1.40 volts.  (I have a 120mm and 80mm fan blowing down on the RAM from the top of the case).  DRAM temps are steady at 32c, with the mobo saying 30c, and the chipset at 50c (the little chipset fan only runs for a bit at boot).

I got my 5900x, and installed it yesterday.  Today, I started ramping up clock rate.  I'm running 1T, GD disabled, and all the other stuff on auto.  I'm still not sure what selecting DOCP does to the CPU, but IF is running 1:1.

I selected small increments of DRAM clock (every two steps - 266 HZ?) and then would run a couple of minutes of MemTest.  I figured I'd immediately get errors after 2800 MHz, like I did with the 3400G, but ended up at 4000 MHz, and Memtest ran for 1.5 hours before I put the clock back to 2800 MHz, and ran an image backup of my system, for when I start doing 'live' OCCT testing in Windows (after an overnight run of MemTest).  I'll probably start at 3600 MHz, so I don't spend a week of overnight runs to see where I get.

Amd,"There's a lot of these reflection posts going on here right now—that kind of mood I guess.

AMD has taken the performance crown in CPUs this year and they're an arm's reach from NVIDIA's performance crown in GPUs.

The value crown is now gathering dust on the floor.

For 3 generations Zen couldn't surpass Intel in performance, but it increasingly offered astounding value propositions, culminating in Zen2. What was so delightful about Zen2 was the value of the chips. People could point to the performance gap all they wanted, but in nearly every situation, other than squeezing out the most FPS in games, Zen2 was probably more worth your money, and you wouldn't go broke. The 3600 isn't legendary because it's the best. It's because it was the best value.

We're all impressed with Zen3 performance. But I don't give a damn that they're faster than Intel. Not only did they increase prices by $50 across the board, they deliberately withheld their better value offerings. During Zen2 it was so common for people to recommend not buying the X variety of 3600, for example - it wasn't worth the price bump. With Zen3, AMD is avoiding this altogether. It makes great business sense. The value crown is still gathering dust on the floor.

When the 5000 series of video cards was released and NVIDIA countered with the Supers, AMD slashed prices of their brand new cards even further. They insisted on making the GPU space competitive in pricing. They didn't even bother with a 5800 series—they focused on getting decent 1440p cards that were often a lot more affordable than NVIDIA's offerings.

With the 6000, they've caught up in the high end. Benchmarks fluctuate, but nobody denies AMD is competitive with all NVIDIA's cards. Good on them—but again, I don't give a damn. I still have to pay more than a next generation console to get their weakest of 3 cards so far. And that's if I can ever find a reference card, because as we're now learning, AIB boards are $100 higher price or more. How much are frames worth? The value crown is still gathering dust on the floor.

I'm tempted by next-gen goodness, but thank god for these supply issues—they're giving me an opportunity for sober assessment. I miss the value king. I think I'll wait patiently for their return.

*Edit:* Yes I get that Zen2 is still available and still a budget option. But A) 'value' is not the same as 'budget' and B) Zen2 offered *value* on day one.",Demise of the value king

in my opinion AMD itself was stunned on the JHH show presenting the cards starting from 499$/699$ and I am sure that AMD real plans were to sell the 6800/6800XT at 650$/730$ price point

so, after the nvidia announcement they were forced to set a new price for the cards in that known 579$/649$ pricetag but what about the AIB? in my opinion they still started to make cards with that 730$ reference price in mind and there's no way we will see something below that line as the real cost isn't that 649$

I am building my first computer in many years and got my hands on a 5800x. I was wondering what kind of cooler it will need since I have seen on here they run a little warm. I plan on OC it.

If it matters the GPU is a 5700xt.

\[EDIT\] -- I am using a Wraith Spire Cooler at the moment. It's a bit old, so a replacement BeQuiet! Dark Rock Pro is on the way.

After a couple of days (yesterday), I noticed that my temps were extremely high (\~90C). This seems normal based on everything I've read. My CB R20 scores for MC are around 5100, SC is 583. I discovered the sheet for everything [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJTPLL4API8XdwmXKknA56u48F4Xgb5vIf5d3PsqDDo/edit#gid=413092447), but have yet to add my numbers because I still don't understand all of them (questions below).

1. What happened to everyone experiencing this? All the comments I see are like 14+ days old. Am I missing something?
2. What is the simplest route to adjusting my settings in BIOS/Ryzen Master to get a decent, average level of performance with this chip? Happy to learn in the process if educational resources (videos) are involved. I've never overclocked before.
3. In Ryzen Master, Peak voltage is constantly changing. I don't see a stored max value anywhere, is it stored somewhere else? Are there any videos explaining where to find these/what they mean? I'd be all over that.","5800X -- High Temperatures, Poor MC Scores, what do I do next?"

It dropped it to maybe a comfy 84-85c(under full load, 100% all cores). Not terrible, but still I don't like it that hot. 

So I change to a 5900X. Just got it last night, went to work, came home and put it in.  I used the ""X"" method I saw some recommend for Ryzen due to chiplets. 

I just did 20 minutes of Cinebench multi-threaded. It hit 66c maximum, but was usually at 63c except a random spike. Holy shit. 

Then I did a single threaded run for 20 minutes, it hit 70c right the start, then went to 66c and went between 66-68c range. 

It was boosting to 4,925MHZ single core. All Core OC was hitting like 4.5GHZ. 

I do not have PBO turned on yet, as it was first boot and i was checking stability.

I own a ASUS ROG Strix Vega 56 OC, and since i bought it i have only had problems with it.
Not regarding the performance, but regarding the temperatures and more specifically the ominous hotspot.
It surpasses 100° almost immediatly after load is applied, and the card starts throttling substantially when it gets to around 105°C.
I have alread opened the card and renewed the thermalpaste 6 TIMES(!!!), and after doing so, the hotspot stays normal for about 2 weeks, but returns to sh*t after daid period of time (i guess with time the thermalpaste retracts?).

One though decision I have now is between coolers and RAM. There is no low-profile 3600cl16 RAM available (at least not low enough, I can move up the second fan, but then it will not fit into the case even with a lowest 3600cl16 I found) which would allow me to fit the NH-D15 into my case (meshify c) with two fans. The vengeance lpx 3600cl18 would fit nicely though.

I read that the NH-D15 with only one fan or the NH-D15s runs only about 1-3 hotter. On the other hand, cl18 vs cl16 will at best make a perfomance difference of 2%, probably even lower than that. Both perfomance and temperature difference seem pretty negligible.

And here in europe it definitely feels like one. But in all fairness for AMD, they would have never been able to cover the demand, even if they tried. 
Nvidia usually covers 80% of the whole GPU market and AMD takes the remaining 20%. Because of NVIDIA’s struggle to have some decent amount of ampere stock, it all kind of fell into AMD’s hands.
And to be clear AMD did try, according to MLID  they increased GPU production but it’s still far from enough to cover what NVIDIA left on the table.

So dear folks please be patient, it’s only been the first week, no need to write the devil on the wall just yet.
Many of us and myself included waited the whole year for the next generation of GPU’s. The frustration of not getting one is understandable but this outrage isn’t. I’m sure if AMD could, they would love to hand everyone a 6800/XT but you’re kind of expecting the impossible.

Hey guys,

I got lucky and managed to buy a RX6800 on launch. Unfortunately shortly after, I saw the real world benchmarks and the disappointing RT performance.

At the same time a buddy of mine sent me a great deal on a pre-built system including a RTX3080 and a 5600x, with both being in stock so I decided to order than instead.

As AMD does not allow you to cancel your order, they shipped the card and it arrived yesterday.

I've seen a lot of people being frustrated at missing out on one so I thought I'd offer it here first before it goes back to AMD and then most likely to a scalper.

I'd be happy to pass it on for the exact price I paid for it + whatever shipping method you want. I paid €596.38 including shipping.

For simplicity and also buyer protection, this is only for people in the EU. Payment ideally through PayPal as it is the safest option (I think?) Or if you live in Belgium you can come pick it up too.

Let me know of any proof you would like me to post.

Now I know how it goes with all core clocks on these. Full load clocks are lower but boost clocks are higher, benifiting games.

But I feel like I'm not getting the results with PBO, or more specifically the Curve Optimizer.

Amd,"I've ordered me a new Ryzen at germanys largest computer hardware reseller three weeks ago. Due to my interest I contacted them about further information. From their statements over the last weeks AMD doesn't deliver them any stock currently, although they are promised new deliveries on daily weekly basis.

On top of that they had to remove the RX6800(XT) from listing due to the promised delivery that had presold at 18.11 weren't delivered on time. But it seems they got them delivered a few days ago, because they relisted them as ""Out of Stock"".

I'm quite concerned that even the big resellers don't get new stock, especially because they get delivery dates by amd that aren't met.",AMD fails to deliver stock to sellers
Amd,"First off, let me start by saying that I have been a long time AMD fan simply because they allowed a cheaper entry to computing, right from the days of the **AMD K6 233** which was significantly cheaper than an Intel platform for a similar performance, to the **Athlon 64 3000+** which saw AMD actually take a lead, to the absolute bang for buck **Ryzen 7 1700** which is my current daily driver.

**AMD**, to me was a **tech ENABLER** because it allowed people without deep pockets to have access to computing.

AMD (ATI) GPU's are on a whole different story arc though, in my country. I remember the **ATI 9500/9700** launched around the time I was ready to upgrade from the Riva TnT2 and get a real GPU, but the **GeForce4Ti 4200** was just waay **better priced** here.

I remember being super excited for the SPIDER platform which was supposed to be an ALL AMD system, right after you acquired ATI, but it was priced insanely high here because of what we as a community now call the ""**Gamer Tax**"" which **scalping retailers** and distributors charge for AMD GPU's and are **enabled by you**.

That glorious shitshow of AMD mollycoddling their India distributes at the cost of the brand image and presence in India has now culminated to what is the last straw for me, the 6800xt pricing. I really want to understand what your marketing/pricing team was smoking when they came up with the current suggested retail pricing structure, because it sure as hell wasn't regular pot.

Nvidia is selling the **3070FE** is available here at **44.5k INR** inclusive of taxes ( 499 USD converted to INR + 18% taxes ). And you priced the **6800** at 46k INR ( 580 USD + 120 USD pot money? ) EXCLUSIVE of taxes, so **54.5k INR** total when you add the 18% taxes. Source : [https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1329054274702209027](https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1329054274702209027)

With limited stocks for the 3070FE and AIB partners selling at around 53-55k price point that may still sell some units since its the better performer, personally I'd just hold out for the Nvidia FE.

But the **6800XT** oh my, you really did a number here, didn't ya. Officially priced at 65k INR ( 650 USD + 230 USD Meth money??? ) EXCLUSIVE of taxes, so **77k INR** total when you add the 18% taxes. Source : [https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1331606098659467265](https://twitter.com/AMDIndia/status/1331606098659467265)

For reference, the **3080FE** is listed by Nvidia at **62k INR** inclusive of taxes ( 699 USD converted to INR + 18% taxes ). Granted that the 3080FE is hard to get, but hard to get is still better than the MIA 6800XT. And how come a price **increase of $70** from the 6800 to 6800XT translates to an **increase of $110** in your official pricing???

AIB 3080s are available right now for a lower price than what your pricing for the 6800XT is, and that is a GPU better at almost EVERYTHING than the 6800XT with several additional features, which is why AMD officially chose to price lower to compete internationally. If this is your India pricing strategy, who is coming up with this? Are people actually getting paid to do this job? Baboons with a typewriter would have a higher chance of not f\*\*\*ing up India pricing for GPUs for AMD at this point.

On a side note, I had preordered the 5950x on the day of launch (AMD CPU pricing is a lot saner in India thankfully), your India Retail partner has stated, in written mail, that AMD is not honoring the stock commitment that they had made to them so the order will be delayed indefinitely. Well played on that front as well.

Amd,"Since yesterday I've been experiencing some weird artifacts popping up randomly for a few milliseconds and then disappear, with no disearnable pattern . The artifacts can only be described as parts of my screen turning white with some RGB rectangles in it. Till now they've only occurred three times in a time span of around 8 hours. The artifactrs appear randomly, regardless of the GPUs usage or drivers (had them happen with 20.4.1 and the latest WHQL ones). I tried to replicate it through stress testing my rx vega 56 with games and different benchmarks, but nothing happened. Currently I'm testing if its my monitor (the 38GN950-b) with my r9 fury, but I highly doubt that its the culprit since this is a new panel and also I havent seen any artifacts pop up.

My rx vega 56 pulse is around 2.5 years old. My bios are stock and I've not increased the voltages pass the stock settings. That said ever since the beginning of this year, my normally stable UV OC of 1.070v at 50% power limit and 900mhz HBM has become unstable. I dont know if this is a sign of a degrading GPU, but I just ignored it and and set everything to stock.

This especially bums me out since I wasnt able to get a reference design 6800xt, I tolled to myself that its ok since I can wait till next year when the prices will normalize (reference design cost arount 720 CHF which was ok, but AIBs now cost 850 CHF which I'm not willing to pay). I can still wait, especially since we're in a middle of a pandemic which is affecting everything, but its still a hard pill to swallow.

Either way I just wanted to share my grieve with you guys. I just hope that AMD can sort out their delivery chain issues over the coming weeks.",I think my rx vega 56 is dying
Amd,"Let me start this by saying, I'm not an early adopter, I'm no hardcore F5'er and I'm not that mad about the ""launch"" just... surprised? Oh and this is in no way intended as a rant, still a happy AMD customer just a bit disappointed about the communication beforehand.

I was actually expecting stock of NV cards be low and the demand to be crazy high, because of all the people that want to upgrade their PC for Cyberpunk and *dem traced rays yo*, also around Christmas everyone goes crazy and feels the need to upgrade their PC for some reason. I planned ahead and upgraded everything else over the course of this year, buying used parts way under MSRP and saving a lot of money I wanted to spend on a big GPU (usually my max is around \~400).

&amp;#x200B;

So expecting a flop, I was surprised seeing AMD telling people that they shouldn't worry about supply at release. Maybe they went a similar route as with CPUs and the chiplets, making production yields more effective or something.  I even gave them the benefit of the doubt, that demand at the Reference Launch was way higher than they anticipated because of the whole NV situation and being interested in AIBs way more I just waited it out. Hearing how the reference cards sort of got restocked everyday I was looking forward to yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday put the nail in the coffin for me of having any hope of finding a new GPU this year so I'll happily hold onto my used RX480 (which I got for free actually) and spend my money on a new Headphone + Mic setup, a new Phone and maybe even a notebook. It's not worth my time getting my hopes up just to be disappointed again so I won't even try to get one for the rest of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closing this off, AMD... please. Next time just be brutally honest and say that you don't have enough supply and that it's really hard right now to get production up and running like it used to before 2020.  People will take you way more serious and actually be understanding of something like this. I like shiny new tech like everyone else but I actually value honesty and communication **a lot more.** I just don't understand why companies can't talk to their customers like normal people anymore.

Just my **0,02€** (exc. taxes)

Hope everyone of you fine people has a nice day! :)

Now, this is probably me just being a peasant but, AMD this year really hasn't shown that much love to the budget community. Nor has Nvidia. I don't care for the RTX in graphics cards since I still play 1080p. I heard rumours of a RX 6700 but that's gonna be like 300+ again.

Amd,"Hello all. I literally just got done watching a Gamers Nexus video regarding the 3300X's architecture stomping on the 3100s. I also just got done scouring YouTube in search of some vids that show a in game with benchmarks comparison of the two. And I saw the glamor that is the 3300x. Now granted, one video I watched was where the person used a 1080ti. Obviously, there's an issue there. But regardless, my question here is if the 3300x only steamroller the 3100 if there's still enough of a gpu to finaggle out? Like with the 1080ti, because it's just ridiculously not getting put to use as much with either cpu, I'm wondering here if the 3300x wins only because there was so much more wiggle room to play with. 

Reasoning for my question here is because my first pc build, upcoming in a handful of months, I was thinking of a 3100 with a 1660ti. But then I read, heard, and saw the dust up with the 3300x and now I'm completely wanting to flip and go with it. My only concern is that I believe at a minimum the 1660ti gets as little used as like 95% in certain games. Is my thinking wrong here in that with that little left to make up for 99% usage, that the 3300x won't actually perform better than the 3100?

When attempting to stream at 4k to the pi 4 (which must use HEVC at this resolution for a non-laggy experience), the stream works, but every half-second or so the screen becomes blurry briefly. It then clears up for a another half-second and then gets blurry again. Depending on what is on screen, it's either very noticeable or barely noticeable, but it is always happening. It even happens on the ""Big Picture Mode"" menu, so it's not just ""in game"", it's the stream itself.

My Pi4 is hard wired to the network. Even if I do 1080p with HEVC, the issue is present. If I switch over to software non HEVC encoding, everything looks great (as long as I'm at 1080p or lower, as the Pi4 struggles at higher resolutions without being able to use it's hardware HEVC decoder).

1, Manufacturing: When trying to find these products, so many people are getting mad at Sony, Microsoft, Nvidia &amp; AMD for not making enough of their products. The reality is they are trying to make them as fast as they can and in some cases have been manufacturing them for a large portion of the year before they were released. The problem here lies with the chip manufacturing.

AMD released 5 new Ryzen CPUs &amp; 3 new Radeon GPUs this year, in addition they also supply the CPU &amp; GPU in the new Xbox and PS5 (which are not the same). This means that AMD alone needs 7 different CPUs and 5 different GPUs to be manufactured to meet these demands. Nvidia has released 3 new GPUs and Apple has several new phone and computer chips that just came out too. The thing about all off these releases, is TSMC &amp; Samsung manufacture all of not only these chips but pretty much every other companies chips in the world. And all this demand all at once means production will be slower for everyone as their capacity is limited.

2. Demand: This years demand for new products is higher than ever. With the pandemic causing everyone to stay at home more than ever before, people are looking for things to entertain them. This increased free time in addition to not spending money on going out or even gas like they used to is leading people to buy more than ever before. It's no longer just the handful of people looking to buy the new hotness, and demand for these new items has more the tripled this year. Adding this demand to the manufacturing issues means inventory for everything is currently gone as companies have to now wait for AMD and Nvidia to provide them with more chips to finish off their products. Sony, Microsoft and GPU board partners can have almost fully finished products but until they receive those chips they can’t sell anything.

3. Scalpers: Because of the increased demand, the appeal of trying to profit off of it is also higher than ever. Scalping is at an all time high with people camping websites all day to buy as many of these items as possible so they can resell them at a higher price to people willing to pay more so they don’t have to wait. Bots have made this and increasingly bad situation as they can process a checkout in under a second in most cases. Some of these scalpers are taking so much of the available stock they have more than some retailers ever had such as the case of the single stapler who claims to have acquired over 3500 PS5’s. This makes it just very hard for normal consumers to get a product from a retailer at MSRP before they are sold out.

All This being said, its pretty clear that it is an over all bad situation all around for trying to get any of these new items. The products are being made, and companies want to get them to us as fast as possible. They want to sell them even more than we want to buy them, but with the demand and supply issues as they are it will just take time. Microsoft has stated they do not expect anymore xbox systems until April 2021 and it may be similar for most of these other products.","The reasons you can't find CPUs, GPUs or Consoles"

Anyone else running the 5700XT and still enjoy it?",You know? 5700Xt isn't bad
Amd,"It isn't a big deal that AMD doesn't have stock. They have too much on limited fab right now with the amount they have to dedicate to console and CPU. GPU has to take the back seat to these 2, they have to honour deals with Sony and Microsoft and Ryzen has a better reputation so needs the fab space to prop that up and keep the intel beat down going. Especially for Ryzen as this is getting to market asap to claim the crown before 11th gen intel potentially takes it back.


It is also unexpected that Nvidia would have stock shortages, AMD usually cater to a smaller market share so we can forgive them for thinking Nvidia would have good supply and only there would be only small demand for people taking up Radeon cards at the high end. This is not where Radeon has garnered any reputation over the past few years.


Add to that higher covid demand with no room to mitigate that, and it's fairly clear that something miraculous would have to happen to make huge numbers of Radeon chips.


But why the paper launch? Why not stockpile a little first?
I think this is the first anticonsumer bit, they have clearly rushed to market to get the reviews out showing 6000 series is competitive with Nvidia. This will make consumer hold out for Radeon cards and not go Nvidia right away. This is a bit of a dick move as they will be launching knowing they won't have enough stock and so will be leaving consumers waiting but hopefully enough will. This makes business sense, better than doing the initial announcement now when prospective buyers have already decided to go Nvidia, and I think is part of the normal games these companies play at launch. This is the reason for paper launch, and I get it.

The bit I really don't get at all, is AMD saying they will have stock, saying they will have more volume than Nvidia and making bets on twitter this will be the case. The only theory here would be that again, like the last point, they are trying to get people to hang on to the commitment to Radeon as long as possible. But it's kind of obvious that will blow up in their face. Maybe they're hoping the anger would be short lived, and at least some of those waiting for Radeon will carry on and not switch to Nvidia.

This really flies in the face of the 'good guy' persona AMD had been promoting. Bringing huge generational leaps in CPU without significant price hikes for the whole Ryzen series, having reasonably accurate benchmarks in launch demos, unlike nvidias crazy charts and 8k dodgy claims. They have a populous sub here and a lot of fanboys for the reason that they are rejecting a lot of anti consumer practices. They could have kept that going by being honest about stock and won a greater mindshare of people thinking 'this honesty is refreshing'.

I know everyone says they're just a company, they're after you're money, well that's true, but AMD was getting the huge underdog support and making their money based partly on their more consumer friendly practices. Sure they did it for more sales and money, but that's the way a free market should work, we vote with our money. I think their recent lies have put us in denial whether it's worth voting for them. They no longer seem consumer friendly, instead just a slightly cheaper, non-RT GPU, which to me is kinda meh.",Yet another stock post

Did you just get your zen 3 and are having problems getting any display out of your mobo? Did you follow Gigabytes SHIT instructions to a T but still no luck? Well I have just the solution for you!

So I knew I'd probably have to flash my mobo but the instructions said I'd need to go in to bios to do it, or press End on POST screen. Well that made me think my mobo was DOA since I couldn't get output from anything. Online posters claimed a DVI cable works when nothing else does, so I hunted one down with my old GPU and still nothing. Tried creating a support ticket on Gigabytes nightmare of a help center but gave up after the page signed me out half way through just by switching to another tab to check my ram model.

Rant done. Here's how you fix it. You need to download the latest BIOS file from their website. You need to rename the .1Fj or whatever file to ""GIGABYTE.bin"" (their website doesn't even mention this!!!) and put it on your fat32 formated USB stick. BTW I bought a 3.0 thumb drive specifically to do this. SURPRISE! It only works with a USB 2.0 stick. (Website doesn't mention this!) If it helps anyone I ended up using my cameras microSD with a USB2.0 adaptor and it worked. You need to have no cpu, ram, m.2, or videocard on the mobo, ONLY the 24 and 8 pin power cables.

Put the 2.0 stick on the white marked usb, flip the power on, and after a few seconds press the q-flash button. After a couple seconds it should start to flash the LED and the psu will spin the fan. It may reset during this process before continuing to flash the LED for a few more minutes. When its done it will stay on but the flashing will stop, then you can power it down and finish putting it all together.

I use obs to record, not stream.

Which is better for my options?

6800xt or 3080?

I heard 6900xt or 3090 would bottleneck and drop frames.

Personally I want the highest frames while playing/recording to really utilize my 240hz monitor investment playing in 1080p, 24 inches only.

I don’t care for graphics and all of that even tho I’ll be playing on Warzone highest settings.

I’m a noob to this so a slight breakdown would be great. A lot of benchmarks on YouTube put the 6800xt getting higher frames but not all are showing benchmarks for 1080p. 

So to ask again, 6800xt or 3080 for Warzone, highest settings, recording via obs?

And would the 6900xt or 3090 be bad? Or is it toooo much overkill as Warzone really isn’t even optimized that much for pc. 

If I can’t get any of these cards, I may just grab a 2080ti until the stocks go up, grab a new card and give the 2080ti to my nephew. (Not worried that the 2080ti is still expensive.

Amd,"So I started researching into this when the screenshots of the chiphell poster were circulating with a 5900X running on an AsRock A320 mobo.  So, it turns out a couple of things happen to be true.  First, AsRock's B450/X470 motherboard line is pretty much a copy pasta of their B350/X370 line.  Second, how AsRock develops it's BIOSes is that they make an X470 BIOS and then they ""downmix"" them to their B450, X370, and B350 boards.

Therefore, it's a reasonable assumption that you can just flash a 400-series BIOS onto their 300-series counterpart.  In fact, there have been several successful examples of this on Techpowerup and Overclock.net forums.  After that, just update to the newest beta BIOS that AsRock just released and then you'll have Vermeer support.  Hopefully you have a CH341A bios flasher lying around in case you have made any errors in judgement up to this point. 

For the initial flash, you need to use flashrom to flash the BIOS instead of the built in utility or flashback.  This is the cleanest way to update the BIOS; the BIOS's built in utility always leaves some code because it's running the flash itself.  Flashrom also bypasses AsRock's authentication that blocks people from flashing a BIOS from the wrong model.  Be sure to backup your initial BIOS because the BIOS contains the serial number, which is helpful for warranty reasons.  If you need to RMA, you'd need to flash back to this BIOS because flashrom wipes everything.  I used the-stilt's modified BIOS for the initial flash.

After that, my motherboard identified itself as the B450 Gaming-itx/AC (with a B350 chipset).  Then it was trivial to update to the newest BIOS using the built in BIOS updating utility on a Ryzen 7 1700.  Because of this, I can also confirm that AsRock/AMD did not remove support for 1st gen Ryzen when they added Vermeer / Ryzen 5000 support, even on a 16MB BIOS.  1st gen Ryzen works fine with the newest BIOSes.

See attached screenshot for verification: https://imgur.com/LgQ9jet  (pay attention to the motherboard / chipset)

If anything, this proves that there is no hardware chipset limitation nor BIOS size limitation on Ryzen 5000 series support on B350/X370 motherboards.  It's very possible, the motherboard manufacturers just need to put in the work.  I can't imagine it's a lot of effort seeing as how simple this flash was.  Certainly in the realm of more experienced hobbyist BIOS modders.  

Anyone else tried this yet?

And here I am with (in my opinion) my kinda high end 3600, 5700xt and a 1080p, 144hz freesync monitor build in my little bubble thinking that I got very good hardware for which i paid 200, 400 and 200 EUR (thats 2 minimum monthly wages in my country) and I feel like a peasant while reading the opinions of the elitists. 

But to be honest steam hardware survey shows that 65%+ of users are gaming at 1080p and most likelly are using similiar or even cheaper hardware than me. And I just can't stop thinking that this new generation of hardware is such a dissapointment for an average gamer. You might say that the mid range gpus haven't released yet but as far as I can tell for the same price of my current gpu with this new generation of gpus I will be able to get a new gpu with none or minimal performance gains because everything got more expensive and now we have RTX also which everyone is excited and crazy about but which won't be used by 65% of steam users because the hardware is too expensive and the performance is too bad and after getting to play with higher refresh rate than 60hz even 58fps can be felt and it sucks and there is no way that I and a lot of people will upgrade to a higher gpu tier or will get significant performance increase at the same price and going up a tier to 1440p will be very expensive because monitors cost more than gpus sometimes and I will be loosing high fps if I am not upgrading my gpu too.

TBH I am really not sure where I went with this post but I feel that gaming industry is aiming 2 tiers higher than an average gamer and and seeing this subbredit and tech reviewers eat it all up when companies offer people experimental technologies which inflate all prices sucks and I needed to rant about this.

TL;DR Prices are stupid, average gamer is 2 tiers lower (1080p, not 4k) than this subbredit and tech reviewers are trying to sell to the masses and I needed this rant to feel better.

Amd,"UPDATE:
Thanks for the silver, kind redditor. Though, Reddit award is also a kind of unnecessary spending (imo).

Be it Nvidia or AMD, new GPU launches in the past few years have always been plagued by initial supply issue. This is why those new cards are often priced much above MSRP initially.

Scalping also does not help the situation because there are plenty of average joes out there who are willing to participate in such vile practice.It is also worth mentioning that the global pandemic is literally causing longer delays along the supply chain.

If you still have a functional high-end last gen GPU in our PC, be grateful. There are plenty of people out there that have planned to upgrade/build a new PC but can't because of worsening financial situation. There are also those in regions where they would never see a proper distribution channel, and therefore getting scalped by their local retailers.

GPU is a luxury item. If you can afford the unreasonable price hike, that's your choice. Otherwise, just be patient because I'm sure that you can live without it for the next few months. Heck, I might argue that we should just wait for 3rd gen Navi to get that ""Zen 2 - like"" feeling.","New GPU is a luxury item that is in high demand now. If you cannot afford the premium for being an early adopter, then just be patient."

Amd,"I'm no AMD fan boy. In fact, I have hardware from Intel, AMD, Nvidia in active use. This short comment isn't meant to sugarcoat the highly disappointing launch. I'm disappointed, too. The issue AMD ran into is a combination of things AMD knew beforehand and things that AMD could not predict. 

What AMD knew: 

During the course of 2020, manufacturing of PS5 and Xbox APU, new Ryzen and Epyc and also manufacturing of the new Radeon GPUs would all happen on the same limited 7 nm node capacity that AMD bought at TSMC. 

AMD knew that it would have to fulfill important manufacturing contracts at first. Business customers (EPYC, Radeon Instinct) and their relations with Microsoft and Sony are most important right now. They knew that there would be a high risk that their limited capacity at TSMC might become overloaded.

What AMD didn't know:

Covid 19. Supply chain issues. Extreme demand on IT parts all over the world. Very limited space on cargo ships. As of now, it's almost impossible to get space on cargo ships. That's why a lot of products from Asia are low on stock in Europe or USA. Prices for air freight also increased. Early 2020, shipping one kilogramme via plane cost about 1,20 bucks. A while later, that price went up to 7 bucks. And as passenger flight travel is down, the cargo space in all those planes that happen to be on the ground now is missing, creating delays in the shipment of light items like a CPU or a stick of RAM.

A possible conclusion:

Private customers like you and me, even the enthusiasts, are of importance regarding pushing brand value/public view of a company. But we are of lesser financial importance than their business customers which is why we currently get the leftovers that come of a silicon die. Simply put: We, as the single customer, has low priority in the big scheme of things. 

If Covid hadn't happened and demand for IT parts was normal, I think the launch of RTX3000, RDNA2 and Ryzen would have went better than the shit show we're seeing right now. 

If AMD had the possibility of buying more TSMC capacity, they would have done so 100% percent, as they could have made way more revenue if they had items in stock. They simply couldn't as TSMC can only sell them so much: They have other customers, too. 

My prediction is, that we won't see an improvement in the coming weeks or even months. The worldwide shortage on IT parts will remain for a bit and the issues in the supply chains will remain, too. A manager of a huge German logistics company said, and I quote:

""We have everything that can swim on the water.""

Amd,"I’ve been in the pc hobby for a few years now and I decided to upgrade. I went from a rx 580, to a rtx 3070. So far the performance is way better, obviously, but it isn’t quite as high as i would like. In gta v I get around 60 FPS on ultra with only a few settings turned to high. My utilization is around 70 to 90 on cpu and only under 80 on gpu. CS go is worse. On low settings with high shadows I get around only 200 FPS with 70 percent utilization on gpu and 80 on cpu. Newer games like Cold War on ultra everything including ray tracing gets between 70 and 90 FPS. All games are run in 1080p on a 240 hz monitor. Cpu has a 36.00 multiplier and gpu has a slight clock speed oc to just over 2 ghz, along with around +500 MHz on vram. I have never touched voltage or power limit on anything including ram. I keep ram at 3000 MHz with xmp. I would like to be more competent with over clocking but I need a lot of practice.

I never really OCed a GPU before but wanted to really test this card compared to the 3070 I had. So I watched a few video's etc and went at it today.

We still game at 1080p, but the 580 is showing its age in some titles and we want to max out what we currently play.

Watched a couple of reviews that I could find, Nitro+, Red Devil, XFX Merc Speedster whatever. They are not better than the reference card in any way that I'd find meaningful. Couple more fps, couple of degrees cooler, can't say they are significantly quieter. Dual bios... I just want a card to play on, not OC. And only the higher tier cards have the Type-C port that I need, so that's fun.

And barely any of them would fit in my case with 315mm length clearance.

After the GN review I was kind of made to believe the reference cooling was not that amazing and can be improved by partners. Everyone put a dumptruck size cooler on the thing, but to what end? Probably my expectations took a wrong turn somewhere.

I was quite surprised how pumped HUB Steve seemed at the end of the Nitro+ review, so I watched it twice, but I couldn't find anything amazing to be excited about. Derbauer was more into how much more OC can potentially be achieved on the Red Devil, so I kinda got that. OC3D I don't watch ever, but he was the only one with XFX, and it didn't seem very high standards testing so that's a pass. KitGuru, similar to HUB.

Though I would like to know what's going on with the 3000 series, it's not like Samsung don't have capacity.

But here's my honest opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

|\-|Radeon 6800 xt|RTX 3080|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Price|**$649**|$699|
|Ray-tracing|Unplayable, quite equivalent to non-existence at this point. Future driver updates / game optimizations *might* improve it.|**Mostly playable. With DLSS, almost all games playable at 4K.**|
|A.I. supersampling|Not yet. Coming soon, *maybe*.|**DLSS which works great now and has VR support for its 2.1 version**|
|1080p rasterized gaming|Overkill|Overkill|
|1440p rasterized gaming|**Overkill, seems better than 3080 in a few titles**|Overkill|
|2160p rasterized gaming|Playable|**Playable, seems a little bit better than 6800xt**|
|VR gaming|Great.|**Super good, significantly better than 6800xt since the resolution is ultra-high.**|
|Rendering|Okay|**Quite a lot better. Not as great as a 3090 but still, better.**|
|Video encoding/decoding|Sucks ass, as always.|**Great.**|
|A.I. training|Huh?|**Great, but I guess most people use cloud services anyways**|
|Hackintosh|**Flawless support. But I wouldn't do Hackintosh anymore since M1 is a great value.**|Nope.|

&amp;#x200B;

So.. It's only reasonable to get a 6800XT over an RTX3080 in one of the following scenarios:

1. The RTX3080 is totally unbuyable, and the 6800XT is easily buyable.
2. 6800XT being significantly cheaper. To me, $50 isn't enough to compensate but for some people's use case it might be a good deal.

I honestly don't understand why there would be people paying $800-$900 for a 6800XT. I don't understand why people would be scalping these either. Being cheap is about the only thing of 6800XT that's better. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're buying from a scalper anyway which means the price difference isn't that big a deal to you, why don't buy a 3080 from scalpers? Not that I don't hate scalpers, just saying. ",Why in the world would anyone scalp a 6800xt? AIB or not. They have not scalping value whatsoever.

Amd,"The current lack of supply for new CPUs / GPUs is incredibly frustrating, but if anyone deserves the #1 spot for worst negative backlash, it should be the retailers. Why?

* Egregious failure to counteract bots and address coordinated scalping efforts. No CAPTCHAs, no checkout priority for ""known good"" customer accounts, etc. **There is basically ZERO risk for scalpers to do what they do. At best, they make 100% profit or more, and at worst they can sell surplus product right at MSRP and take minimal (if any) losses.**
* Failure to implement a queue or other signup system, without which many people resort to using stock trackers or refreshing webpages. Even with these tools, most are still easily outraced by bots and those who want to secure their own purchases waste many hours dealing with this. Queue systems let customers quickly and easily secure their spot in line (and monitor it over time) without the stress and time waste that comes with having to constantly track retailer inventories. (Some retailers do this but they are outliers)
* Inadequate communication on release dates/times, prices, product listing pages, etc. ""Hiding the listing pages"" isn't an effective bot countermeasure and if anything gives scalpers another advantage, as they have greater ability to find products immediately when (or before) they go live. Obfuscation hurts real customers and does not make up for a lack of legitimate countermeasures.
* **Most importantly, these problems have happened countless times before and yet are still not addressed in meaningful ways.** 

Obviously AMD and Nvidia deserve some negative backlash for how these launches have gone (not to mention some of the relevant Twitter fiascos), as everyone down the chain must ultimately answer to them if they want orders fulfilled. **Were there always going to be major shortages?

Amd,"So this is all anecdotal, and far from scientific, just my own personal observations...so grain of salt and all that.

System specs:
CPU: AMD 5900x
Motherboard: MSI Meg x570 Godlike
Videocard: Zotac 3090 Trinity
Memory: 32 GB 4000 MHz Crucial Ballistic Max RGB
Boot drive: Samsung 980 1 tb
Case: Bequiet Dark Base 900
Power Supply: Bequiet 1100 watt

Assembled the system and on initial power up found the pump on the Corsair h150i was DOA, and I noticed that the Dark Rock could ship and arrive in a few hours so I ordered it and installed it. Fired up a fresh windows install and ran some benchmarks and Prome 95 to test the Dark Rock out.

I booted the RAM into the xmp profile (4000 MHz) and set the Infinity Fabric fclk to 3800 (i know its uncoupled, but MSI hasn't released the updated BIOS yet and I didn't feel like testing out my motherboard yet to see if out of the box it could support 1:1)

For what its worth I also undervolted the 3090, which surprisingly gave me HIGHER number in firestrike and time spy.

My idle temps with the system like this were 51 C. Ran Prime 95 for 8 hours and saw 91 C.

A few days later my Corsair h150i came in so I installed that. This bequiet case has some quirks. If you want to install the AIO radiator on the front you interfere with the ability to mount mechanical drives, and a top mounted radiator has air flow restrictions. Since I have a bunch of mechanical hard drives I couldn't install it on the front, so that left the top.

So the next question is fans on top or underneath, and is the air intake or exhaust? Perfect world i guess it'd be exhaust with the two 140 mm fans on the front supplying fresh air intake, but if you exhaust with the radiator up top and the fans underneath the hot air being pushed up through the radiator doesn't have much space to freely exhaust. If you swap the fans to the top and try to draw air through it made me wonder how efficient it'd be and I thought I'd try to just suck fresh outside air into the case through the radiator.

I know theoretically I'd be just getting that air up and blowing it INTO the case, but here were my thoughts:

1. The warm air would blow directly down and into the air path of the 140 mm exhaust fan located right below.
2. Any air not immediately exhausted would blow onto the CPU, which is being cooled by colder outside air not inside case air...sooooo...net positive I guess?
3. I didn't think to measure motherboard temps before, but after its sitting at 39 right now, which I'm not terribly worried about.

So, long winded explanation aside, installing the Corsair AIO dropped my idle temps by 10 C to 40 C and my load with Prime 95 running for 8 hours by 13 C to 78 C.

These temps seem fairly cool, there doesn't seem to be a lot of temp data out there yet about the 5900 yet, so I'm not sure.

But I can say that this AIO seems to work really well. It was a lot easier to install than the Dark Rock, too.

If anyone wants the Dark Rock, let me know.",5900x air vs. AIO cooling observations (bequiet Dark Rock Pro 4 vs Corsair h150i)

However Frank Azor has been out there saying there WON'T be stock issues... and now they have WORSE stock issues than Nvidia. Crazy.

2) They lifted review embargo at launch time, hiding bad RT performance and the general performance of the cards. Just anti-consumer and should be called out.

3) The AIBs didn't give pricing to reviewers on the third party cards. Now that we see the prices are almost all $800+, it's obvious why. Every one of these reviewers if they knew the price was going to be $800 would have said for this price you should buy Nvidia.

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?! 

Rumors all over saying today it was going to be AIB's launching, but nothing yet. Anyone have any ACTUAL information about what is going on and when it's to be expected. Bestbuy/Newegg/AMD/ and others keep saying ""coming soon"" or ""out of stock"" but never WERE in stock.

Amd,"Simple question, does anyone know which RX6000 models come with the usage indicator LEDs? 

For those who don’t know what I mean, the R9 Fury were the first to be equipped with 9 LEDs along the power sockets. One showed if the card was in ultra low power mode or not, the other eight showed GPU utilization. Two small dip switches allowed for the user to select blue light, red light, both (so pink/magenta) or off. 

Vega came with this as well, and even some AIB models kept it. 

Leaked images of RX 6000 development boards had the LEDs. But all the released cards I’ve seen on the internet do not. The pads seem to be there on the PCB, just not populated. 

As I own a Fury and two V64, I’d miss this feature. Does anyone know if it’s still there on some obscure high-end variant? Is it maybe something they relegate to the 6900xt only?

What's y'all's opinion on AM4 life span? It's amazing AMD used the same socket for all Ryzens to date and I'm wondering if they'll continue to do so for, for example, the next gen processor whatever it may be. Now, I don't expect anyone here to be a telepath or a time traveler, I'm not asking for a confirmed yes/no. I'm wondering if anyone has read anything anywhere that may hint AMD going one way or another, I googled it and haven't found anything too relevant.

If this isn't the place for a post like this, lmk!

Edit: Found this,  ""Somewhat surprisingly, AMD left open the possibility that the AM4 socket  may continue past the Zen 3 generation.  “This will depend on the  schedule of industry I/O technologies,” Hallock wrote. “Such technology  changes typically require adjustments to the pin count or layout of a  processor package, which would necessitate a new socket.

Amd,"I'm one of the lucky few that was able to snag a 5600x and so started my first AMD build in over 15 years.  Not as intimate with this platform, I did what I normally do which is to install the ASUS suite of drivers and applications on a fresh windows 10 install.  I used AI suite 3 on my intel ASUS build for the fan controller and it never created a problem on my x270 board w/ 7700k.  

After installing the Armoury Crate app with the AI Suite 3 I started noticing shut down was slow with ""Armouryswagenname"" refusing to stop.  Assumed this was a problem with the Armoury Crate app.  Tried uninstalling it - seemed to uninstall cleanly but AI suite 3 I kept.  Still had slowness on shut down.

Benchmarked Middle Earth Shadow of War using same settings on my intel build.  All I changed was the 5600x, x570 and 3600 memory (vs 3200 on intel).  Still using 1080 ti and same graphic settings.  7700k was 4.8 all core OC

Benchmark on 7700k: 97 FPS 

Benchmark on 5600x: 84 FPS, then 86 FPS, then 87, then 88.  best I could get was 88...but it was inconsistent.  I'm thinking...wtf?  This isn't how this should be going.  Granted I'm running 4.65 stock clocks vs 4.8 but...still.  Something's wrong.

So I reformat.  Follow the same install process...this time didn't install armoury crate...just AI Suite.  Consistent this time at least but 87 FPS every time.  

Then I tried uninstalling AI Suite 3...seemed like it went fine....but still slowness on shut down...and FPS unchanged.  But then I started noticing the device removed noise on startup.  Something was still wrong.

Finally decided to do a third reformat.  Installed Armoury Crate this time with JUST DRIVERS.  No AI Suite 3.  Everything else the same.  Same software, same install order, same settings.

Benchmark now on 5600x: 95.  Then 95.  Then 95.  Then 95.  Consistent and as is would expect compared to an overclocked 7700k in gaming.  

TL;DR: DO NOT install AI Suite 3.  Control fans in bios.  8-10% gaming performance hit on a fresh clean install with nothing different outside of AI Suite 3 that cannot be corrected by uninstalling (and yeah I did ccleaner registry cleanup) is simply unacceptable...and nearly had me VERY disappointed in AMD over all this...when it was just shitty software from ASUS.","PSA: ASUS x570 users - AI suite 3 kills performance and once installed, cannot be cleaned up"

Nvdia could also develop arm apu with nvidia graphics for laptop or desktop.

Amd," Hi fellow AMD supporters.

I have an AMD RX 6800 on the way! (Managed to pry it from the cold dead hands of the bots!). I plan on keeping this card either for the short run until I can get a hold of the 6800XT, which was impossible to get on launch day in the UK or I am considering just keeping it for the long run as I need to direct funds else where next year.

My builds theme is cyan with a touch of pink, check out my battlestation post for context. Ain't no place for red I'm sorry (minus the Godlike's wee LEDs). If I am going to keep the 6800 for the long run (depends on how it preforms at Ultra/V/High 4k) I want to customise the shroud and led logo. Likely with paint and maybe something clever to remove the red plastic led cover.

I've watch ~~GamersNexus's~~ Tech Jesus's teardown and I see the cards cooler uses a thermal pad. If I dismantle this card for customisation, can I reuse the pads and thermal interface?

Amd,"Hey guys, I wanted to write my own experience with updating the BIOS on a ASUS motherboard for anyone upgrading to 4th Gen Ryzen.

Last night I had some trouble flashing a new bios on my Asus B550-i Gaming using the flashback button (brand new motherboard, needed the new bios to boot with my 5600x). I followed the instructions provided on the user manual but with no luck: **the indicator LED would just blink 3 times and then stay on. No blinking, no activity light on the USB stick, nothing.** I tried different USB sticks with different capacities, different bios versions, still nothing.

So, I found out after some digging that the USB stick needs to be a **MRB disk (Master Boot Record)** instead of a **GPT (GUID Partition Table)** for the motherboard to be able to read the bios file and install it. My knowledge of what both of these acronyms are and in what regard they differ is very limited, but I'll leave you with the steps I followed to prepare my USB stick.

1. Connect your USB to the computer;
2. Press **Windows key + R** to open RUN;
3. Type **diskpart**, it should open a cmd window;
4. Type **list disk**. Note the disk number of your USB;
5. Type **select disk &lt;disk number&gt;**;
6. Type **clean**;
7. Type **convert mbr**;
8. Type **create partition primary**;
9. Type **format fs=fat32 quick**;
10. Type **active**;
11. Exit the cmd window.

Now you should have a fresh MRB USB disk, ready to receive the BIOS file and flash it to your motherboard.",My experience flashing the bios on a ASUS Strix B550-i Gaming

Amd,"I don't know much about computers, and I don't know anything about Risc-V to comment on it. I see that ARM has a ton of upside to its potential, especially in the hands of companies like Apple and Nvidia who can really help it reach new heights. And maybe new nodes from TSMC plus AMD's creative ingenuity will keep x86 competitive for at least 5 years. 

For those of you more knowledgeable in processors and computing performance, do you see a point at which ARM overtakes X86, and will the two trend parallel with one another, or will ARM leave X86 in the dust? Can AMD (or Intel) core power, along with 3D stacking and other breakthroughs that may come in the future, be enough to compete with ARM in 5 years? And at new nodes such as 5nm, 3nm, and beyond that, does that allow X86 to stay relevant?

Sorry if I sound ignorant because I'm kind of new to technology and stuff. I just watch youtube channels like Coreteks and I am under the impression that ARM is looking really good down the line and that x86 is living on borrowed time.

Amd,"Hi all. Just have a quick question here. I've been trying to OC my RAM to get the most out of my system (2 x 8gb T Force Delta RGB 3200mhz CL16) and I've not been having success past 3200 using a modified XMP profile. I even tried using Thaiphoon and the Ryzen DRAM Calculator. No dice using even the ""safe"" values.

So, I let my BIOS due the tweaking for me. I manually set a 36 multiplier and 1.45 voltage and let the motherboard auto adjust the timings (I run a B450 Aorus M). I was able to get a stable 3600mhz clock, but at CL22. For the sake of trying, I tried playing some CoD Warzone and to my amazement, I'm actually getting around +20 fps compared to the normal 3200 mhz XMP profile.

My understanding is that the Infinity Fabric on the 3300x runs at the DRAM frequency, therefore higher is desired. But I also read that shorter latencies should generally lead to better gaming performance. Is my manual OC really better than the default XMP? Or is this simply a one-off case for one game, and I shouldn't expect the same results in others?",Higher RAM frequency or lower timings for 3300x?

Amd,"Hello everyone,

I'd like some guidance on how AMD is handling RMA requests, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(The following is mere background. I don't feel this belongs in the tech support megathread, because I'm confident I know what the issue is.)

I received my AMD Ryzen 7 5800X in the mail last Thursday and installed it into my computer with no problems. It worked perfectly until Saturday, when I began to notice artifacting on images and videos on multithread applications that like to use as many cores as possible, including Firefox, Discord, and Darktable.

I deduced that the CPU had a faulty core by running a simple blend test with Prime95. At stock clocks and voltages, the first seven cores were running this benchmark perfectly, while the threads (workers) in the eighth core (15 and 16) instantly failed the test and told me about a hardware error. So I disabled the eighth core in msconfig, and the artifacts disappeared after I restarted my computer. They only appear when the eighth core is activated.

I opened an RMA request with AMD this morning. However, I've never had to do this before, so I'm not entirely sure what to expect from them, much less from any RMA process at all—especially during a global disease outbreak that's constrained AMD and its ability to support its customers, one way or another. So I have a few questions for /r/AMD:

1. Has COVID-19 impacted AMD's RMA process in any way?
2. What turnaround time can I expect for an RMA request for a newly released CPU?
3. Have you personally done an RMA with AMD during this time? I'd be interested in hearing your personal stories.

Amd,"What's up??

If you're not into overclocking and getting the most from your CPU, this might be boring for you.. Also, I'm sorry if you all know this and I'm late to the party (:

If you're doing the same and testing, please post your results and share what you're doing to achieve them so we can all learn from it!!!

I have a 5900X and I'm currently playing with the ""Curve Optimizer"" and am getting the best results I've seen on my CPU!

**I'm getting 646 single core and over 8900 muti in r20!**

*A little context..*

I thought I was getting the best performance I could without a manual overclock by using custom PBO settings and setting the curve optimizer to negative 10 all core. 

I couldn't get lower than negative 10 to work for all core. I even tried doing per-core and at first I tried increasing on what I thought were my best cores (through HWInfo).. I tried -15 on a few different ones at different times and it just didn't work for me.

I was tired of trying things and gave up for a while..

With a manual 4.7GHz OC I was looking at 8900-9100 (mostly below 9000) in r20 but my single core score would suffer, dropping to \~617 from \~635. I even tried per CCX (or CCD?) overclocking and it just wasn't stable, 4.7GHz all-core seemed to be the best manual OC I could get.

Before, I was using the curve optimizer and only PBO and was seeing \~8500 multi and - 625 single which was easy to reproduce.

With custom PBO + negative 10 all-core curve optimizer I was just barely getting over 8700 multi and \~635 single (642 was max I've EVER seen and couldn't reproduce it). 

**After adjusting the curve optimizer per core**, along with PBO, I was able to get 8950 multi and 646 single in r20. Over 640 is now common.

**That's nearly as good as a manual OC, I can literally get the same multi core score now AND get higher single core score! That's exactly what I've been working towards!**

**ALL-CORE OVERCLOCKING IS DEAD!**

I was hitting 5GHz here and there but now I'm hitting over that just ever so slightly AND more often. I'm seeing 5150MHz on one core, 5075MHz on another and 5050MHz on the third one that reaches 5GHz. I've actually seen two of them hit 5150MHz but not sure if was at the same time (probably not).

I'm seeing 4850MHz and 4775MHz often on several cores (up to 6) while playing Apex when it use to be 4400-4675MHz. I'm also seeing 5GHz while playing when I've never seen that before while playing Apex. What this translates to actual FPS I have no fucking clue. 

**What did I do?** 

After seeing the thread about PBO2 with the video (didn't watch it) and seeing AMD\_Roberts replies, it regained my interest, so I went back to the BIOS to try a couple things..

Instead of sticking to one number for curve optimizer for all core, or just trying to set what I thought were the best cores to lower numbers, I actually started from the bottom, raising each number except for the top 5 (because I tried higher numbers before and failed) and did a lot of testing. I could get the bottom number to 70 but that didn't help much more than 40.

**Currently, this is what's getting the results above (curve optimizer per-core):**

1. Negative 10
2. Negative 10
3. Negative 10
4. Negative 10
5. Negative 10
6. Negative 35
7. Negative 35
8. Negative 35
9. Negative 35
10. Negative 35
11. Negative 35
12. Negative 35

Seems simple right? Maybe some of you already figured this out, but for those who want to push your CPU a little more, do some testing. Try my numbers. BUT also try testing other numbers and combinations.. Each CPU may work differently.

I did eventually try higher numbers again in the top 5 but it resulted in crashes or lower r20 scores. I tried positive numbers here and there, I tried keeping a few cores the same numbers, I tried decreasing in increments from bottom to top. For instance, I tried (from the bottom) 70, 60, 50, 40, 35, 30, 25, 15, 10, 10, 10, 10.. I saw a decrease in performance but it still allowed me to run tests without crashing. This is all kind of weird and new to me.

My PBO settings are manually set to:

* Precision Boost Overdrive: ADVANCED
* PBO Limits: MOTHERBOARD
* PBO Scalar: Manual, 5X
* MAX CPU PBO: 200MHz
* Platform Thermal Throttle Limit: 255 (max)

SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO NOTE: before I was playing heavily with the curve optimizer, I found that OCing the RAM, whether increasing frequency or tightening the timings, DECREASED PERFORMANCE (on top of the WHEA errors obviously)!!!! That's why I'm running XMP ONLY at the moment. But after playing with the curve, I might try tweaking it again, but may have to wait for a BIOS update. Not sure.

**Here's my specs (RAM is running XMP only!):**

* 5900X
* B550 Gaming Carbon
* GTX 1080 TI
* 2x16GB Crucial Ballistix RGB 3600 Cl16 Dual Rank
* RM850",Curve Optimizer - Better Than Manual OC!

So, I game at 1440p with a 5700XT and I know there's a CPU bottleneck happening.

It seems that the R5 3600 pairs perfectly with my GPU, and its price is amazing right now. Let's say I can find it for 200 bucks, I'll do some rough conversions. And let's say that I can find 3600X for around 210 bucks.

However, now we have 5600X around and, probably, 5600 soon enough.

I know that 5600X is only 15% faster in 1440p games, but I can't find it for less than 400 bucks where I live.

If the 5600X delivers just 15% more fps in 1440p, we can conclude that the 5600 will probably deliver less than that, closing the margin to the 3600.

Also, the 5600 will probably be sold for around 300 bucks where I live (it's usually 20-25% more then the american MSRP).

I'm coming from an i7 7700 so it's a big leap.

I paired it with a MSI X570 Gaming Edge Wifi (and saw the YouTubers reviews after about the VRM overheat issue, but no issue so far) and for the cooler I use a Corsair A500 I bought on special.

Let me know if you have any questions you may have or things I can test for you (if I have them).

I have a Fractal Design Meshify C + 2 intake fans  in the front and 2 exhaust fans (1 above the A500 and 1 at the back) with some custom fan curves around that (let me know if you want me to share them).

It's been a while since I built a PC. I want to put together a $1000 gaming PC for my nephew and would like some input.

&amp;#x200B;

I can handle the other parts but would appreciate help with the above.",Suggestions for a $1000 gaming build
Amd,"So I, hyped about the new gaming gains, ordered 5600x few weeks ago. Received the processor surprisingly, 2 days after that. I also ordered msi b550m mortar, after evaluating what board would be good, and easy to setup. Without too much hastle with the update. After 2 weeks of wait it finally arrived, and here begins my horror story.

So I was pretty sure that I would need to update my bios, but I had no way to know that for sure, but to try the board. I had every part for the pc ready, so why not just build the pc, and update the bios if I needed to. First mistake. 

So for no ones suprise, it didn't boot, got EZ CPU light on. So I thought yeah, I need to update the bios. I open the manual, check how to do it, download the latest stable bios for 5600x, and do as the manual suggests. I plug the stick, and start the update. After 10 mins, I start to think that this shouldn't take this long, but afraid to turn the pc down, I let it run. After 1h 30min - 2h I gave up, and started searching around internet.

Apparently lots of people have this same exact problem. And the solution to this is to use program like Rufus to format disk to fat32 MBR. And no other components attached to mb, besides power supply. So I did that. No progress. Apparently people are saying that it depends a lot of your usb stick, and it works only on some sticks.

So I gather all usb sticks of my crib, and also borrow few from roommate. Total 7 usb sticks. Format all to the correct format, put the bios there, and start running the updates. No stick works. 

So me and my roommate think after about 4 hours of bs, that this pretty fcking stupid, and we should just disamble his 3600x from his pc, and just use that CPU to upgrade the bios. It didn't even boot. Neither did the flashback do anything different. 

So I do my last efforts to fix this. Search the exact usb sticks, people have got this bios to update with. Go and drive 10km to nearest store that sell them and buy 2. Now at this point I was pretty frustrated, so I thought, I'm gonna do this EXACTLY as in manual, just to be sure, and not to do any community suggestions. Nothing. So I do the community suggestions. Still nothing.

So, after 7+ hours, about 9 hours in total if you count the initial assembly, I figured that if me and roommate with about 15 pcs collectively can't update this bios, it's either that we are too stupid to update this bios, or the motherboard is broken. Going for the latter, I finally just returned the motherboard.

In total, this operation required 2 Ryzen processors, 9 usb sticks, in sizes 8,16,32. Usb 2.0 and 3.0. This is a story I think everyone who was dreaming of easy fresh ryzen 5000 build should hear.

Anyway, I use my desktop for a mix of  gaming (no streaming), school work, and occasional light video editing.  My display is 1080p @ 165hz with no immediate plan to upgrade, though  maybe in the not-so-near future I'll jump to 1440p.

My  plan is to upgrade to a 1070ti (old, but the best I'm aware of that's  in my budget of $200 - $230 max).

Given my uses, which do you think would be a better match with this GPU?

**Current build is as follows:**

Ryzen 3 1300x (not OC'd)

Amd,"So I have found that the orientation of the 6800XT can drastically affect the cooling, has anyone else noticed / able to confirm this?

* Motherboard horizontal, GPU vertical - excellent cooling, \~60-70C hotspot, even cooler 'GPU' temp. (coincidentally, how nearly every review seems to test)
* Motherboard vertical, GPU horizontal (sideways sag) - reasonable cooling, \~75+C hotspot, slightly cooler 'GPU' temp.
* Motherboard 90^(o) vertical, GPU vertical (length ways, 90^(o)) - horrendous cooling, 110C+ hotspot, 75C+ 'GPU' temp.

Now in my tests hitting the 110C hotspot causes the card to throttle back quite heavily (2-300hz) and rightly so if 90^(o) vertical placement causes the vapour chamber to cease to function. It surprised me because (with my limited knowledge on them) if the chamber worked so well in the vertical on a horizontal motherboard I foolishly assumed it would work just as well vertical 'longways' (90^(o) rotation).",6800(XT) card orientation seems to make a difference

Amd,"As the title suggests I am interested in the 5800x as this is the last cpu my strix x570-I will take and want to get around 3 years out of it. I like stuff running in the background and sometimes stream with a friend so I opted for more than 6 cores. 

I play vr games and have a rtx 3070 and thought the single ccx 5800x made sense for latency. I know it will likely get hotter than the 5900x because of the single ccx. I don’t need this as a workstation. 

I understand the 5800x isn’t good from a value proposition and could be $50 cheaper. I understand for $100 more I get a lot more cores and slight single core boost. But if I don’t need the cores and more cores doesn’t necessarily make it last a lot longer is it worth it. (Forget about availability for a minute)

So what made people who initially wanted a 5800x jump to a 5900x? The only thing I see besides more cores is some specific games have higher minimum frames than the 5800x. But not across the board. 

Thanks!",What made you go 5800x -&gt; 5900x ?
Amd,"Just upgraded or so I thought from a 2080TI, to a Reference 6800XT.  I am running a Pimax 8kx (4K) and this runs notably slower (10-20%) than the Nvidia ?  New to team red am I missing anything on settings? This seems very odd.

My other thoughts are either Drivers need some work or that maybe 4k is too much for this card.

This is being run on Iracing which is a pretty basic in terms of graphics and load.  I was getting 75-80 frames before now barely 60fps

Update: Both cards were OC'd with blowers, I had to OC the XT as it was just horrible in rage mode.

Update 2:  Decided to sell **not** scalp the card, after looking into the babel review in more detail on the 4k pancake its evident that the 6800xt is not great at 4k.  You can see in most of the games there is like a 25-30% delta between the 3080 an XT.  Which is about inline with what Nvidia said it comparing the 3080 to a 2080 which was about 50% and more likely about 25-30% on the TI.

I'm working on upgrading my tower and I'm debating a pure AMD build. I felt the need to reach out to the community to see if anyone has heard of issues with math software on these set ups.

I'm comfortable with OpenCL so that will not be a huge issue.

**Changes I made:** I ran this optional driver update yesterday called AMD - System - 2.89.0.66 and installed it onto my Ryzen machine. 

**Symptoms:** But, ever since doing that, my boot times have suddenly become long (my machine used to turn on within 10 seconds of hitting the power button) and my audio driver has also started malfunctioning, I woke up my device from sleep and my speakers and headphones stopped working. 

**What I think is the solution:** Based on my update history I seem to have been running ""AMD - System - [2.73.0.35](https://2.73.0.35)"" which was working flawlessly.

Is there any way to roll this update back? I tried going into the device manager to find it but I couldn't do so. So, I'd really appreciate your help.

CPU: Ryzen 5600x

MotherBoard: MSI B550M Mortar

RAM: 16 GB Crucial Ballistix 3000 CL15 (E-die)

GPU: RTX 3080

PSU: Corsair RM750 Gold

I'm also using the stock cooler, for the time being.

&amp;#x200B;

I had my pc running perfectly for 3 days, then I updated to MSI's beta BIOS and the random BSOD started. They started getting worse as time went by. I couldn't boot into safemode, I couldn't boot into windows after a fresh install, instant BSOD. I reinstalled Windows and checked all BIOS settings were default, I rolled back the BIOS, upgraded again, checked logs, daisy chained my 3080 and removed it, checked XMP, disabled and enabled PBO... Nothing indicated what was wrong with my machine. I did several memory tests, overclocked RAM and undervolted GPU, same thing. I then decided to lock the CPU to 4.2 GHz and the BSOD's stopped. Even with a RAM OC and GPU UV. After 1 week of having the CPU locked and no crashes, I decided to bring the CPU Ratio back to default, and when I booted my machine it BSOD again after 10 or so seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it confirmed it's a CPU issue? Does anyone with a 5600x also have the same issue?

For the monitor i wanted to be able to utilise the advantages that come with using AMD. However, i am not very knowledgeable in this area since i am still learning. I decided to go for a MSI optix 27"" monitor due to the fact that is 144hz and it has freesync. I figure this could be a good thing but i don't know the extent.

Finally the last AMD product I have gotten is the GPU.

So, my understanding is that the programmability of FPGAs means that can be reconfigured to serve a lot of different functions, and my understanding is also that one of those functions is that they can serve the role of cells of SRAM, as used in most forms of cache.

Well, what made me think of this, aside from the Xilinix acquisition, is that apparently, at least for TSMC's 5nm node, SRAM isn't scaling super well, but logic is.

So a thought I had is that. Well, what if AMD cheated, and instead of using a big L3 cache made of SRAM that's harder to shrink, they used an FPGA and had the FPGA spend most of its time in an ""L3 cache mode"" or something?",Could an FPGA be used as cache?

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"So looking at various vendors Europe (mostly France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands), it struck me that a 6800 costs on average between 800-850 euro. the 6800XT is nearing the 900-1000 range.

What is up with these prices?? Is this normal pricing, or a capitalization on the demand? 

Prices for the 5700XT were never this bad, and were much better aligned with the MSRP in dollars. 

For comparison: The MSRP of 5700XT was 399 USD. You can get a pretty decent 5700XT for around 450 euros on average, which is fine, considering taxes here in Europe and what not. 

But an MSRP of 580 and a sales price of around 800 euros, what's up with that?

To set it up I connected another DP cable directly between RX 6800 and monitor.

Then I selected USB-C video out as main monitor and disabled DP output.

Then I switched monitor to the only active input.

So far so good. It works very nicely and mouse, keyboard and monitor work correctly. There is an issue with my USB audio driver having static noise after a few minutes but that's another issue.


The main problem however is that I am not able to restart my computer with just USB-C connected. The display stays black, USB devices however work correctly.


Before I had a 2070 super with USB-C and that worked flawlessly...

Is AMD aware of this issue and is anyone else experiencing this??

I mean, it was (and is) so bad that AIBs have taken it upon themselves to directly dig even further the Rx 6000 series with insane prices of the AIB models and some retailers in Europe are straight up scalping these cards despite having no stocks. 

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro.

Amd,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share that I've got a Ryzen 5 2600 up and running on an MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard. Here is a CPU-Z validation: [https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq](https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq)

I'm creating this post, because I couldn't find enough information, if the motherboard will work with my CPU. Officially, the CPU is not supported by the motherboard (and from the B550 Chipset in general), but I found some comments here on Reddit and other forums that it might work, so I decided to give it a try. Here is what I had to do however, in order to get everything up and running.

Initially, the motherboard didn't boot with the Ryzen 5 2600. I decided to try and update the BIOS with MSI's Flashback to the latest BIOS version 7C91v14. With the CPU still in the socket, the Flashback didn't work as well, although theoretically it should work even with an installed CPU. The red LED for the Flashback blinked multiple times and then stayed solid for over 10 minutes and the other lights on the motherboard didn't light up, which meant that the Flashback isn't working.

I had to remove absolutely everything (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU) from the motherboard and leave only the 8 PIN CPU power connector and the 24 PIN power connector. After the BIOS flash, I installed the CPU, RAM, GPU and SSD and the PC booted without any problems. Everything (PCI-E Gen 3 including NVMe, SATA, XMP Profiles, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) seems to be working fine for now. The CPU is also recognized in the BIOS correctly.

One small note about using the Flashback: The USB drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and an MBR scheme. The flash might not work, if the scheme is not MBR.

Amd,"I have been eyeing the PN50 (specifically the 4800U) ever since it was announced and been unable to find stock anywhere.  I have an aging BRIX that won't stay booted on me anymore and really wanted a Ryzen replacement. I'd seen a few PN50 videos here and there so I knew it was out there, but was still unable to find it available for purchase.

I happened across the SimplyNUC Aspen, which is just a PN50 barebones with some components installed to make it functional. I attempted to order from their website and while it appeared there was stock to purchase, I was having trouble getting the item into the cart.

The site has an online chat, so I connected with Greg who was very helpful.  I was looking for a 64GB 2TB unit but found that the 64GB was not 3200, so I bought the cheapest model (4GB, 128GB M.2) with the expectation to buy better stuff on Newegg.

He said very clearly and confidently that they would ship in 2 to 3 business days and that he could send me a link to complete the order.  I paid at the link and for ovenight shipping (on a Wednesday) and went to Newegg to buy my 64GB HyperX and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2.  

I received my memory on Friday and my M.2 on Saturday.  On the 3rd business day (Monday before Thanksgiving) I messaged again to make sure that I would be receiving my computer on Tuesday as I was leaving the country on Sunday and knew packages wouldn't arrive on turkey day.

Unfortunately, the rep Piper told me that none were in stock.  They had received stock, but not nearly enough for the outstanding orders and that I would not be receiving my product until sometime in December.  She suggested I reach out to Greg to find out why I was guaranteed one in 3 days.

I emailed Greg who was very apologetic and was going to get to the bottom of it.  I heard back saying that they only had the 4700U in stock and would happily send me that and refund the difference, but that the 4800U would not be in stock until the first week of December.  He also offered to cancel the order outright but since I had already spent 600 bucks on the memory and drive, I was not too excited about that idea.  I told him I'd sleep on it and let him know.

The next day I saw Gigabyte announce their new BRIX S with Ryzen 4800U so now I had a dilemma on my hands.  I loved my BRIX, but I really didn't want to get stuck in the same loop I did with the PN50 due to availability issues, so I decided to stick it out if I was ""guaranteed"" one in December.  I'd arrive back in the country before Christmas and was resolved to wait it out.

I emailed Greg and he said it was extremely likely it would come in the first or second week of December so I agreed to wait. 

On Thanksgiving day however, I received a very odd phone call from FedEx saying I had a package on the way and to be there Friday to sign for it.  I checked my email and saw that sure enough, SimplyNUC had sent me a fedex from their Austin offices on Thanksgiving day.  I crossed my fingers but did not want to get my hopes too high that my 4800U was in transit.

Friday about 10am I hear a knock on the door and lo and behold there is a box from SimplyNUC with a PN50 inside.  And after close inspection it was my beloved 4800U.  They managed to get me one before I left the country after all.  

I will say that through all of the communication with Greg and Piper, they were terrific to work with. They were very apologetic and wanting to work with me for the best possible outcome even if it wasn't my first choice outcome.   Thanks much to SimplyNUC for getting me my perfect system just in time for my travel.

Oh, and the PN50?  I'm very pleased with it so far.  It's so much faster and quieter than my BRIX, even setting the fans to performance mode.  I couldn't be happier.

**TL:DR**

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted. 

What are your opinions?

Should I go for the 5800x or the 5900x?

Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

My network was optimal, my settings were optimal, my software was optimal, yet my VD experience was ass.  A factory reset did not help, nor did setting all visual options to the bare minimum (including 72hz).

Amd,"So I was one of the lucky few that got the 6800 xt, however I'm noticing a few problems with it after gaming with it for a while.   
There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

* Crosshair VIII Hero
* 5950X
* Kraken Z73 w/ QL120 pegged at 100%

Originally, I went into the BIOS, turned on PBO and just went about my business. Recently, an NZXT cam update came out allowing me to monitor Zen 3 temps on my AIO LCD, and I noticed I was hitting high 80s while gaming. This seemed quite high, so I went and turned off ""Core Performance Boost"" as well as PBO in the bios and my gaming loads went to rarely breaking 60C.

Then I get the latest beta of MSI afterburner finally allowing me to monitor CPU while gaming. So I do some gaming and I realize that the CPU is pegged at 3400 mhz, so no boosting at all. I went and turned ""Core Performance Boost"" back to Auto, and now I'm boosting up to 4.9 ghz, but my temps are hitting 80C at times. It's worth noting that Ryzen master always reports a temperature that's anywhere from 0-9C lower than the temps reported by Afterburner and NZXT Cam. Pretty sure this is package vs core temp.

Should a 5950X with stock boosting be hitting 80C on a 360 AIO with fans (I know QL120 are crappy for rads) pegged at max? A few of my fellow 5950X owners are saying they have PBO turned on and are in the 60s while gaming?!",What are normal 5950X temps?

&lt;rant&gt; 

I purchased a new Ryzen CPU on the launch date within the first two minutes. (I used multiple computers with the same account to get that small advantage in case one lagged). At the moment of purchase, I was given an ETA of about a week. Which I thought was very quick. 

Then upon checking daily on their website, I found out it date was changed to the week after.

Again, no big deal, there is a pandemic going on. I checked my email and received no correspondence (typical for PLE they expect that you check their website). 

So the date came around and I got ready to go pick it up, and just before leaving I checked their website and they had changed the date to the week after that, again in typical PLE fashion without email correspondence on the date.

Currently it has been 24 days after the launch and nearing a week after my last ETA, with no real reason as to why it took this long nor a reason why my 3 ETAs were not accurate. They promised thousands of units on launch day but I’m still unsure why I, as a customer, was treaded this badly. Am I overreacting and entitled? I mean I did spend a very large sum of money (for me) with them so :/

Without making identifying comments, this has happened to me before, for other products (that aren’t as popular), with PLE and their perpetual ETAs. I hope I get something at the end of this.

The Lenovo IdeaPad S540 is a very performative office laptop with all-round potential and a price tag of 750 Euro (~$900) despite the manufacturer cutting one or two corners along the way.

We were somewhat annoyed by the display: While it certainly isn't bad, it can't keep up with the results of last year's panel. Contrast and the black value, for example, have become less good and even the brightness distribution isn't what it was. Presumably, Lenovo wanted to save a little money with the new panel. 

Another thing Lenovo was a little stingy about is the SSD: Although again this isn't a bad model, the Western Digital SSD can't quite keep up with the Samsung PM981 SSD in the device's predecessor.

Both these changes do not make the new S540 a bad laptop and the alternative hardware still is fine. Plus, the new IdeaPad 540 now features a new AMD Ryzen processor that is really impressive.

Amd,"Hi everyone,

I've had a Ryzen 5 2600x in my system for a while now with the stock Wraith Spire cooler.

I recently bought a high airflow case and noticed the fan was whining even at idle.

Just yesterday I decided to check the temps and fan speeds with HWInfo and while the temperature was 40c at idle, the fan was at ~2400 rpm.

I rebooted into the (latest) BIOS of my MSI B450 Pro Carbon AC (non MAX) and saw the default configuration began at 55% fan speed.

More specifically, it was set as 55% speed up to 35c,  70% speed above 50c and 100% fan speed over 60c.

That's absurdly high for no reason at all.
I immediately changed it to:

 20% @ 40c

45% @ 50c

65% @ 60c

100% @ 75c

Booted into windows and lo and behold it's MUCH quieter now at idle and light use.

After 3 hours of gaming it topped at 74c which I find perfectly reasonable for everyday use.

Amd,"I've been unable to find much information about this setting. This is the toggle found under the 'Graphics' tab of the Radeon Settings; not the one found under the 'Display' tab.

On my monitor, an LG 34GN850 (supposedly a 10bit panel), I notice a few things after enabling the setting. It definitely interferes with Freesync. I don't see the refresh rate change with framerate; Freesync is still being detected as on though. 

However, I'm unable to see any tearing....anywhere. Vysnc on or off, doesn't matter, no tearing. Does it enable and enforce some kind of buffering at the driver level? 

I want to say that I notice a bit more color depth but it's hard to say. Something does seem better or at the very least different but it could just be in my head. I feel like motion seems a bit clearer but 'jumpy'. The best way I can find to describe it is that it feels like looking at a really fast flip-book but when disabled Freesync adds blur between frames and thus seems smoother but a tad bid muddier.

When comparing to it off, motion does seem blurrier. Regardless of whether Freesync is on or off in the driver or the monitor. Likewise with Vsync. And as expected, tearing comes back with all three settings off.

Nvidia advantage is obviously RT and it seems like higher framer rate at 4k...

Is there any reason why I should keep ref 6800 XT ? 
Giving the same price (3080 Is even 20 dollars cheaper in my case...)
Better RT performance
Better 4k average frame rate

Build details here: [https://pcpartpicker.com/b/MY8MnQ](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/MY8MnQ)

I run a 1080Ti for my GPU while gaming at 4K, and I didn't realize how much my 3770k was bottlenecking my GPU. Sounds kind of funny to hear in retrospect but I think I was losing about 10-20% fps. Anyway, I did notice that running benchmarks like CB R20 and Prime95 would toast the 5800X up to 83C even on my NH-D15S with its A15 and 4x A12x25s blowing full blast.

However the temperature is only a problem for multithreaded applications. Gaming is still mostly single threaded and even with EcoMode turned on, there was very little degredation to CB20 single thread and gaming fps (SoTTR and Witcher3, mainly GPU bound in 4K anyway).

So here's my workaround to the high temperatures:

* Enable ECO mode 65W
* \+200 AutoOC
* Dynamic undervolt (I have mine set to -0.1V)

I'm sure curve optimizer would help out even more but right now the F11i bios from gigabyte is very buggy and I cannot re-enter the bios once I flash it. With these settings, HWInfo would report max temperature of 60C while gaming and fans are silent. While multithreaded benchmarks do suffer, in practice, I can still have multiple browser tabs, discord, telegram, youtube, etc. while gaming and cannot perceive any degradation. 

Overall I am very happy with this setup now that I have tweaked it to my liking. I can still get the maximum frames from my GPU while the system is quiet and drawing minimal power. I also undervolt my GPU and still get 50-60+ fps in 4K games. Hope my experience will help you guys on the fence or hesitant about getting a 5800X.",5800X temperature workaround for gaming

&amp;#x200B;

I backordered the 5900x on release day at the Burnaby, BC, CanadaComputers location. While paying for the backorder deposit, I naturally asked the employees to check how many people are ahead of me in line for the 5900x. An separate employee that wasn't helping me at the cash register proudly shouted out 'FIVE! There's 5 backorders so far'. (Back orders are per store and not linked with online order or other stores).

So I was quite content being with #6. Thinking on the next resupply I'll have a high chance of getting one. Today I walked in to buy a motherboard and check on the backorder queue/status. Guy that assisted me checked my backorder position and said I am **TENTH** in line. Now, I immediately knew what shady shit happened. Even though employee says they must've just made a mistake or system broken. I am certain that some shady employees fixed the backorder positions up for their friends or family.

There's no way that guy that so proudly shouted out (when not even being asked directly since his not the one assisting me) the amount of backorders their store got on the 5900x is wrong. On top of that, the way this employee checked and then whimpering-ly told me ""You are 10th in line"". It just screams to me that his not the one fixing the backorder positions but he knows it's been fixed by someone and others have came checking their backorder positions and he had to tell them the same shit. Then having deal with the angry customer after. Now I knew there's nothing I could do about it, so I just expressed how fucked up that was with a few words and then left.

Somehow I wasn't too surprised, knowing even their store managers are scalping shit for themselves before anyone can even buy them.Some extra info he checked for me: (This is for Canada, BC)

There's 12 5900x in-transit to the Grandview CC store.

There's 8 5900x in-transit to the most of the rest of the CC stores. (Cool they just happen to have made me #10 in line huh)

Roughly 50 5900x in-transit to CC stores across BC. It will arrive in 1-2 weeks. Next batch zero ETA.

Maybe even have a launch SKU thats different then a post launch sku. This whole situation is bananas and if additional measures are not used to penalize purchased scalped products then sadly the current state we are in will happen again.,Preventing scalpers in the future

Amd,"The flip-flop that this sub does to defend AMD is pathetic

Just months ago, people on this sub said that high-end video cards are so expensive because high-end GPUs have high profit margins.

By contrast, consoles are so cheap because console APUs have low profit margin.

Now that AMD can't make enough GPUs (because AMD is allocating 80% of its wafer to consoles), all of a sudden, high-end GPUs have low profit margins and consoles have high profit margins.",The flip-flop that this sub does to defend AMD is pathetic
Amd,"I really really wanted to do an all AMD system, but after the last 10 days it became obvious to me that:

1. You have to be extremely lucky to get on retail
2. The AMD AIB pricing is ludicrous
3. It seems that the cards are going to rise in price

As a result, I decided that whichever I get first, be it a 3080 or a 6800Xt would be the card I get. If I hold out for AMD, whose launch also seems to be on tissue paper it could take me 6 months.

Funny thing is that I actually bought an EVGA FTW3 three weeks ago, but solid it because of all the horrible experiences people are having, and at the time I believed AMD and thought it would not be impossible to get a video card. Sold it at list price so I did not scalp. The guy who bought it (around 1 min after listing) was so happy and excited. It was cool. I don't regret selling it.

So I started scouring CL. I am in San Diego and there was a solid amount of ads. Some were from predatory scalpers, but those were easy to weed out. Most are well below the EBAY scalping level which I would never do but still really high. It seems a lot of people are getting preorders and EVGA queue orders in and had already found the card some other way. And several would negotiate. It's not a bad way to go with some effort but definitely some risk.

In the end I paid $970.

Seems expensive, but I noticed that BH has it at $799 but out of stock. And AMD has raised the price in their store to $849.

When I saw this it dawned on me that we might be entering another phase where all the GPUs sell for more than MSRP or original MSRP, and availability will remain ultra scarce. So my premium really wasn't all that much around $60-$70 considering tax.

Also the card is awesome. It is really really fast compared to my 1070 TI even with my i5-8400 processor (still waiting for some parts on my 5600X new PC though I have the processor. It is also DEAD silent even at load, and never got about 59 degrees in Time Spy (17556 graphics score so pretty decent)

I am just glad for it to be over. I wanted to support AMD but nothing about their launch is any more consumer positive than what what NVIDIA did.

If $849 is the new baseline, then considering tax and shipping I really did not pay much of a premium at all.",I gave up and went ASUS TUF 3080 OC
Amd,"Consoles will always sell. Most consumers don't care what brand is inside of it. The 6000 Series GPUs are competing with the latest nvidia offering. It's been 15 years or so since they have been this close on the high end. This was the best oppurtunity to grab a huge chunk of both mindshare and real consumers. Yields are great for the size of the gpu, but they still manage to be less available than Nvidia. 

Red Devil OC to 2.7Ghz at inly 335W That's fucking bonkers. This closes the gap between the the RTX 3080 and 3090 in some games. Stock 6800xt tied or slightly worse than 3080, to then tieing or beating 3090. Nvidia does not OC well at all this Gen and it can draw an insane amount of power. It infuriates me even more after seeing some of these AIB benchmarks. The 6900XT will be the halo product AMD has needed, but will be covered in a mostly negative light due to availability. 

I just had to get this out there. I pissed I probably won't get a 6900XT, but even more so that AMD have kneecapped themselves with this launch.",AMD made a huge mistake. This was their chance.

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!
Amd,"So looking at various vendors Europe (mostly France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands), it struck me that a 6800 costs on average between 800-850 euro. the 6800XT is nearing the 900-1000 range.

What is up with these prices?? Is this normal pricing, or a capitalization on the demand? 

Prices for the 5700XT were never this bad, and were much better aligned with the MSRP in dollars. 

For comparison: The MSRP of 5700XT was 399 USD. You can get a pretty decent 5700XT for around 450 euros on average, which is fine, considering taxes here in Europe and what not.

My setup: RX 6800 -&gt; USB-C -&gt; USB-C IF certified cable -&gt; USB-C KVM -&gt; 8k DP cable -&gt; Monitor.

To set it up I connected another DP cable directly between RX 6800 and monitor.

Then I selected USB-C video out as main monitor and disabled DP output.

Then I switched monitor to the only active input.

So far so good. It works very nicely and mouse, keyboard and monitor work correctly. There is an issue with my USB audio driver having static noise after a few minutes but that's another issue.


The main problem however is that I am not able to restart my computer with just USB-C connected. The display stays black, USB devices however work correctly.


Before I had a 2070 super with USB-C and that worked flawlessly...

Is AMD aware of this issue and is anyone else experiencing this??

I mean, it was (and is) so bad that AIBs have taken it upon themselves to directly dig even further the Rx 6000 series with insane prices of the AIB models and some retailers in Europe are straight up scalping these cards despite having no stocks. 

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro.

Amd,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share that I've got a Ryzen 5 2600 up and running on an MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard. Here is a CPU-Z validation: [https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq](https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq)

I'm creating this post, because I couldn't find enough information, if the motherboard will work with my CPU. Officially, the CPU is not supported by the motherboard (and from the B550 Chipset in general), but I found some comments here on Reddit and other forums that it might work, so I decided to give it a try. Here is what I had to do however, in order to get everything up and running.

Initially, the motherboard didn't boot with the Ryzen 5 2600. I decided to try and update the BIOS with MSI's Flashback to the latest BIOS version 7C91v14. With the CPU still in the socket, the Flashback didn't work as well, although theoretically it should work even with an installed CPU. The red LED for the Flashback blinked multiple times and then stayed solid for over 10 minutes and the other lights on the motherboard didn't light up, which meant that the Flashback isn't working.

I had to remove absolutely everything (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU) from the motherboard and leave only the 8 PIN CPU power connector and the 24 PIN power connector. After the BIOS flash, I installed the CPU, RAM, GPU and SSD and the PC booted without any problems. Everything (PCI-E Gen 3 including NVMe, SATA, XMP Profiles, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) seems to be working fine for now. The CPU is also recognized in the BIOS correctly.

One small note about using the Flashback: The USB drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and an MBR scheme. The flash might not work, if the scheme is not MBR.

Amd,"I have been eyeing the PN50 (specifically the 4800U) ever since it was announced and been unable to find stock anywhere.  I have an aging BRIX that won't stay booted on me anymore and really wanted a Ryzen replacement. I'd seen a few PN50 videos here and there so I knew it was out there, but was still unable to find it available for purchase.

I happened across the SimplyNUC Aspen, which is just a PN50 barebones with some components installed to make it functional. I attempted to order from their website and while it appeared there was stock to purchase, I was having trouble getting the item into the cart.

The site has an online chat, so I connected with Greg who was very helpful.  I was looking for a 64GB 2TB unit but found that the 64GB was not 3200, so I bought the cheapest model (4GB, 128GB M.2) with the expectation to buy better stuff on Newegg.

He said very clearly and confidently that they would ship in 2 to 3 business days and that he could send me a link to complete the order.  I paid at the link and for ovenight shipping (on a Wednesday) and went to Newegg to buy my 64GB HyperX and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2.  

I received my memory on Friday and my M.2 on Saturday.  On the 3rd business day (Monday before Thanksgiving) I messaged again to make sure that I would be receiving my computer on Tuesday as I was leaving the country on Sunday and knew packages wouldn't arrive on turkey day.

Unfortunately, the rep Piper told me that none were in stock.  They had received stock, but not nearly enough for the outstanding orders and that I would not be receiving my product until sometime in December.  She suggested I reach out to Greg to find out why I was guaranteed one in 3 days.

I emailed Greg who was very apologetic and was going to get to the bottom of it.  I heard back saying that they only had the 4700U in stock and would happily send me that and refund the difference, but that the 4800U would not be in stock until the first week of December.  He also offered to cancel the order outright but since I had already spent 600 bucks on the memory and drive, I was not too excited about that idea.  I told him I'd sleep on it and let him know.

The next day I saw Gigabyte announce their new BRIX S with Ryzen 4800U so now I had a dilemma on my hands.  I loved my BRIX, but I really didn't want to get stuck in the same loop I did with the PN50 due to availability issues, so I decided to stick it out if I was ""guaranteed"" one in December.  I'd arrive back in the country before Christmas and was resolved to wait it out.

I emailed Greg and he said it was extremely likely it would come in the first or second week of December so I agreed to wait. 

On Thanksgiving day however, I received a very odd phone call from FedEx saying I had a package on the way and to be there Friday to sign for it.  I checked my email and saw that sure enough, SimplyNUC had sent me a fedex from their Austin offices on Thanksgiving day.  I crossed my fingers but did not want to get my hopes too high that my 4800U was in transit.

Friday about 10am I hear a knock on the door and lo and behold there is a box from SimplyNUC with a PN50 inside.  And after close inspection it was my beloved 4800U.  They managed to get me one before I left the country after all.  

I will say that through all of the communication with Greg and Piper, they were terrific to work with. They were very apologetic and wanting to work with me for the best possible outcome even if it wasn't my first choice outcome.   Thanks much to SimplyNUC for getting me my perfect system just in time for my travel.

Oh, and the PN50?  I'm very pleased with it so far.  It's so much faster and quieter than my BRIX, even setting the fans to performance mode.  I couldn't be happier.

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

So hold off from buying an older ryzen processor which I thought I was gonna have to do.

Amd,"Hey guys! I’ve been super lucky to pick up a RTX 3080 and a 5800x! Wanted to share some tips and tricks I have found to help the community out. Please upvote this if it helps you out.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

Amd,"Disclaimer: sorry if this is a little ranty.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted. 

What are your opinions?

Should I go for the 5800x or the 5900x?

Thank you for all the help.",Help: Ryzen 7 5800x vs Ryzen 9 5900x
Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

TLDR: If you a buying a Threadripper for Animation/3D Rendering. Go with a bigger cooler (360mm) and you’ll get much better results under extreme heavy load.

No one seems to have a 5900X and emulate via RPCS3, so I'm asking a more theoretical question but would this be correct? I also re-read Digital Foundry's review on the 2 chips and in 1080p, the 5800X seems to overall perform better there. I'm going to be using that resolution and don't plan on upgrading anytime soon as I also play 144 FPS, so would it be best for me to save $100 and get the 5800X?",How might a 5800X vs 5900X compare in RPCS3 as well as general gaming in 1080p?

There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

* Crosshair VIII Hero
* 5950X
* Kraken Z73 w/ QL120 pegged at 100%

Originally, I went into the BIOS, turned on PBO and just went about my business. Recently, an NZXT cam update came out allowing me to monitor Zen 3 temps on my AIO LCD, and I noticed I was hitting high 80s while gaming. This seemed quite high, so I went and turned off ""Core Performance Boost"" as well as PBO in the bios and my gaming loads went to rarely breaking 60C.

Then I get the latest beta of MSI afterburner finally allowing me to monitor CPU while gaming. So I do some gaming and I realize that the CPU is pegged at 3400 mhz, so no boosting at all. I went and turned ""Core Performance Boost"" back to Auto, and now I'm boosting up to 4.9 ghz, but my temps are hitting 80C at times. It's worth noting that Ryzen master always reports a temperature that's anywhere from 0-9C lower than the temps reported by Afterburner and NZXT Cam. Pretty sure this is package vs core temp.

Should a 5950X with stock boosting be hitting 80C on a 360 AIO with fans (I know QL120 are crappy for rads) pegged at max? A few of my fellow 5950X owners are saying they have PBO turned on and are in the 60s while gaming?!",What are normal 5950X temps?

I purchased a new Ryzen CPU on the launch date within the first two minutes. (I used multiple computers with the same account to get that small advantage in case one lagged). At the moment of purchase, I was given an ETA of about a week. Which I thought was very quick. 

Then upon checking daily on their website, I found out it date was changed to the week after.

Again, no big deal, there is a pandemic going on. I checked my email and received no correspondence (typical for PLE they expect that you check their website). 

So the date came around and I got ready to go pick it up, and just before leaving I checked their website and they had changed the date to the week after that, again in typical PLE fashion without email correspondence on the date.

Currently it has been 24 days after the launch and nearing a week after my last ETA, with no real reason as to why it took this long nor a reason why my 3 ETAs were not accurate. They promised thousands of units on launch day but I’m still unsure why I, as a customer, was treaded this badly. Am I overreacting and entitled?

The Lenovo IdeaPad S540 is a very performative office laptop with all-round potential and a price tag of 750 Euro (~$900) despite the manufacturer cutting one or two corners along the way.

We were somewhat annoyed by the display: While it certainly isn't bad, it can't keep up with the results of last year's panel. Contrast and the black value, for example, have become less good and even the brightness distribution isn't what it was. Presumably, Lenovo wanted to save a little money with the new panel. 

Another thing Lenovo was a little stingy about is the SSD: Although again this isn't a bad model, the Western Digital SSD can't quite keep up with the Samsung PM981 SSD in the device's predecessor.

Sadly, I wasn't lucky enough to get the reference model and decided to not buy from scalpers, I thought when the AIBs will release, I will get a Red Devil (that was my dream card for some time). So I ordered a 6800 XT Red Devil for about 1000€... insta regret. Seeing how they are not even available worldwide, I decided to cancel that order, because I won't be able to get it before Cyberpunk comes out for sure... after few days of thinking, I found a deal for Sapphire 5700 XT Nitro+ and bought it. And while I wnot be able to play the game in 4k60 ultra, as I first planned, I'm sure it will be enough for 1080p144 (I have 2 FreeSync screens). Maybe I will upgrade to RDNA 3 in the future, we will see. Just wanted to say, if the availability was there, I would be ready to overpay for new GPU.

I've had a Ryzen 5 2600x in my system for a while now with the stock Wraith Spire cooler.

I recently bought a high airflow case and noticed the fan was whining even at idle.

Just yesterday I decided to check the temps and fan speeds with HWInfo and while the temperature was 40c at idle, the fan was at ~2400 rpm.

I rebooted into the (latest) BIOS of my MSI B450 Pro Carbon AC (non MAX) and saw the default configuration began at 55% fan speed.

More specifically, it was set as 55% speed up to 35c,  70% speed above 50c and 100% fan speed over 60c.

That's absurdly high for no reason at all.
I immediately changed it to:

 20% @ 40c

45% @ 50c

65% @ 60c

100% @ 75c

Booted into windows and lo and behold it's MUCH quieter now at idle and light use.

After 3 hours of gaming it topped at 74c which I find perfectly reasonable for everyday use.

However, I'm unable to see any tearing....anywhere. Vysnc on or off, doesn't matter, no tearing. Does it enable and enforce some kind of buffering at the driver level?

When comparing to it off, motion does seem blurrier. Regardless of whether Freesync is on or off in the driver or the monitor. Likewise with Vsync. And as expected, tearing comes back with all three settings off.

Nvidia advantage is obviously RT and it seems like higher framer rate at 4k...

Build details here: [https://pcpartpicker.com/b/MY8MnQ](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/MY8MnQ)

I run a 1080Ti for my GPU while gaming at 4K, and I didn't realize how much my 3770k was bottlenecking my GPU. Sounds kind of funny to hear in retrospect but I think I was losing about 10-20% fps. Anyway, I did notice that running benchmarks like CB R20 and Prime95 would toast the 5800X up to 83C even on my NH-D15S with its A15 and 4x A12x25s blowing full blast.

However the temperature is only a problem for multithreaded applications. Gaming is still mostly single threaded and even with EcoMode turned on, there was very little degredation to CB20 single thread and gaming fps (SoTTR and Witcher3, mainly GPU bound in 4K anyway).

So here's my workaround to the high temperatures:

* Enable ECO mode 65W
* \+200 AutoOC
* Dynamic undervolt (I have mine set to -0.1V)

I'm sure curve optimizer would help out even more but right now the F11i bios from gigabyte is very buggy and I cannot re-enter the bios once I flash it. With these settings, HWInfo would report max temperature of 60C while gaming and fans are silent. While multithreaded benchmarks do suffer, in practice, I can still have multiple browser tabs, discord, telegram, youtube, etc. while gaming and cannot perceive any degradation. 

Overall I am very happy with this setup now that I have tweaked it to my liking. I can still get the maximum frames from my GPU while the system is quiet and drawing minimal power. I also undervolt my GPU and still get 50-60+ fps in 4K games. Hope my experience will help you guys on the fence or hesitant about getting a 5800X.",5800X temperature workaround for gaming

While paying for the backorder deposit, I naturally asked the employees to check how many people are ahead of me in line for the 5900x. An separate employee that wasn't helping me at the cash register proudly shouted out 'FIVE! There's 5 backorders so far'. (Back orders are per store and not linked with online order or other stores).

So I was quite content being with #6. Thinking on the next resupply I'll have a high chance of getting one. Today I walked in to buy a motherboard and check on the backorder queue/status. Guy that assisted me checked my backorder position and said I am **TENTH** in line. Now, I immediately knew what shady shit happened. Even though employee says they must've just made a mistake or system broken. I am certain that some shady employees fixed the backorder positions up for their friends or family.

There's no way that guy that so proudly shouted out (when not even being asked directly since his not the one assisting me) the amount of backorders their store got on the 5900x is wrong. On top of that, the way this employee checked and then whimpering-ly told me ""You are 10th in line"". It just screams to me that his not the one fixing the backorder positions but he knows it's been fixed by someone and others have came checking their backorder positions and he had to tell them the same shit. Then having deal with the angry customer after. Now I knew there's nothing I could do about it, so I just expressed how fucked up that was with a few words and then left.

Somehow I wasn't too surprised, knowing even their store managers are scalping shit for themselves before anyone can even buy them.Some extra info he checked for me: (This is for Canada, BC)

There's 12 5900x in-transit to the Grandview CC store.

There's 8 5900x in-transit to the most of the rest of the CC stores. (Cool they just happen to have made me #10 in line huh)

Roughly 50 5900x in-transit to CC stores across BC. It will arrive in 1-2 weeks. Next batch zero ETA.

So if you backordered at a CC maybe check and re-secure your backorder position. Good luck F5ing or whatever it is people are doing now with alerts/bots to try and give amd/nvidia money.",Canadacomputers sus again- backorder line position changed

Amd,"I've been looking for comparison between all of them. In this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XF-rirft8U you can see that lows in MW drops down to 100 while 5900x have much higher lows overall. Most benchmarks you see online are done in singleplayer where the performance between 5600x, 5800x, 5900x and 5950x would be more or less equal. In online games like BFV, PUBG, MW the difference could be much bigger since online multiplayer historically been more CPU demanding. So for 144 fps gaming 5600x might not be ""enough"". What do you guys think?","5600x isn't ""enough"" for 1440p /144mhz gaming?"

Amd,"So with the new gen cards out yet horrible supply, which is better for my needs? I have a 3950x and 64gb ddr4-3600 trident z neo. 

I’m new to computers and I only play Warzone. 240hz monitor to add. My main target is high fps on ultra 1080p settings. 

I’m not sure if Warzone uses ray tracing and dlss? If anyone can answer that, it would be helpful. Without and constrains on price, which would perform better? I don’t play nor plan on buying any pc games in the future except Cold War (ps5 for all my other gaming needs)

To add, I’ll be using obs or elgato to record gameplay. 

So should I get a 6800xt or 3080? Would they bottleneck my cpu? Strictly for 1080p Warzone ultra only. I want the highest FPS.",RT + Dlss 3080 vs 6800xt
Amd,"Hello everyone,

yes, i know, AMD sad, that Ryzen 3000 would not be compatible with the Curve Optimizer. But to be completly honest, i doubt that.

It pains me to say this, but AMD has lied more and more the last few years. For example, the Cut for 300 series Boards, because ""Bios Chip too small"", PCIe4.0 on 300 and 400 series Boards, and the ""new manufacturing process from the 3000 XT series, which has fundamental other transistors than the normal 3000 CPUs"", which we also know, was a lie.

So, back to the point, there is literally no reason, that the curve optimizer would not work, when the only thing different between 3000 and 5000 chips is the Chiplet architecture, even the IO Die is exactly the same.",Ryzen 3000 with Curve Optimizer
Amd,"I’m sure there’s a lot of you out there like myself with maybe a few friends that are really interested in PC but who are still on consoles. I’ve been telling a few poor souls to wait since like March for Ampere, RDNA 2, and Zen 3. At this point we all understand the supply issues and the extreme constraints that a global pandemic places on these companies. I don’t harbor any negative feelings towards either AMD or Nvidia, it’s just disappointing. I feel weird about recommending older GPUs right now. I don’t want my friends expectations to be let down in any way, especially when they are already spending 1k plus on their builds. Call me crazy but I think that spending  that much should get you an experience that is far superior to that of the series x/ ps5. Right now the only way to have a build that matches the consoles is to have some equivalent to the RTX 3070/RX 6800 or better. All in all it makes me sad that people aren’t able to build their PCs right now.",Is anyone else tired of telling their friends to wait to build a PC?
Amd, Yesterday i spent 900(including monitor) in newegg to build a pc around a 3070 or 6800 (when available) but i start to regret do you think is worth to build a pc around a gpu that cost the same as a ps5? I only use mi current laptop for word and light work besides games.,Existential doubt.

Amd,"Hi I was wondering if anybody had good sources where I could go and spend money to get a rx 6900 xt as soon as it was available. I'm in the US, anything helps thx.",PreOrdering a Card
Amd,There should be some means of denying warranty for products purchased from scalpers to de-incentivize the behavior. Maybe time gate it so that any warranty claim for a product that shipped from the manufacturer for 3 months after launch would require the original credit card number used to purchase(for the life of the warranty)? Maybe even have a launch SKU thats different then a post launch sku. This whole situation is bananas and if additional measures are not used to penalize purchased scalped products then sadly the current state we are in will happen again.,Preventing scalpers in the future

Amd,"The flip-flop that this sub does to defend AMD is pathetic

Just months ago, people on this sub said that high-end video cards are so expensive because high-end GPUs have high profit margins.

By contrast, consoles are so cheap because console APUs have low profit margin.

Now that AMD can't make enough GPUs (because AMD is allocating 80% of its wafer to consoles), all of a sudden, high-end GPUs have low profit margins and consoles have high profit margins.",The flip-flop that this sub does to defend AMD is pathetic
Amd,"I really really wanted to do an all AMD system, but after the last 10 days it became obvious to me that:

1. You have to be extremely lucky to get on retail
2. The AMD AIB pricing is ludicrous
3. It seems that the cards are going to rise in price

As a result, I decided that whichever I get first, be it a 3080 or a 6800Xt would be the card I get. If I hold out for AMD, whose launch also seems to be on tissue paper it could take me 6 months.

Funny thing is that I actually bought an EVGA FTW3 three weeks ago, but solid it because of all the horrible experiences people are having, and at the time I believed AMD and thought it would not be impossible to get a video card. Sold it at list price so I did not scalp. The guy who bought it (around 1 min after listing) was so happy and excited. It was cool. I don't regret selling it.

So I started scouring CL. I am in San Diego and there was a solid amount of ads. Some were from predatory scalpers, but those were easy to weed out. Most are well below the EBAY scalping level which I would never do but still really high. It seems a lot of people are getting preorders and EVGA queue orders in and had already found the card some other way. And several would negotiate. It's not a bad way to go with some effort but definitely some risk.

In the end I paid $970.

Seems expensive, but I noticed that BH has it at $799 but out of stock. And AMD has raised the price in their store to $849.

When I saw this it dawned on me that we might be entering another phase where all the GPUs sell for more than MSRP or original MSRP, and availability will remain ultra scarce. So my premium really wasn't all that much around $60-$70 considering tax.

Also the card is awesome. It is really really fast compared to my 1070 TI even with my i5-8400 processor (still waiting for some parts on my 5600X new PC though I have the processor. It is also DEAD silent even at load, and never got about 59 degrees in Time Spy (17556 graphics score so pretty decent)

I am just glad for it to be over. I wanted to support AMD but nothing about their launch is any more consumer positive than what what NVIDIA did.

If $849 is the new baseline, then considering tax and shipping I really did not pay much of a premium at all.",I gave up and went ASUS TUF 3080 OC
Amd,"Consoles will always sell. Most consumers don't care what brand is inside of it. The 6000 Series GPUs are competing with the latest nvidia offering. It's been 15 years or so since they have been this close on the high end. This was the best oppurtunity to grab a huge chunk of both mindshare and real consumers. Yields are great for the size of the gpu, but they still manage to be less available than Nvidia. 

Red Devil OC to 2.7Ghz at inly 335W That's fucking bonkers. This closes the gap between the the RTX 3080 and 3090 in some games. Stock 6800xt tied or slightly worse than 3080, to then tieing or beating 3090. Nvidia does not OC well at all this Gen and it can draw an insane amount of power. It infuriates me even more after seeing some of these AIB benchmarks. The 6900XT will be the halo product AMD has needed, but will be covered in a mostly negative light due to availability. 

I just had to get this out there. I pissed I probably won't get a 6900XT, but even more so that AMD have kneecapped themselves with this launch.",AMD made a huge mistake. This was their chance.
Amd,"Dear AMD and AMD fans,

As the title suggests, over in r/HPReverb we are slowly discovering how terrible some of the USB Chipsets in, the supposedly premium, X-570 motherboards seemingly are when trying to use HP's newest VR headset. We've even had reports of B-550 and X-470 boards not working as well.

Boards affected are (updating this section, still plenty more)

*Boards the headset doesn't work with*

-ROG STRIX X-570-e/B-550-I Gaming

-ASUS TUF GAMING X-570/B-550

-MSI B-450 Mortar Max

-Unspecified Tomahawk X-570

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing. Many of us, as of now, have $600+ paperweights sitting in our houses and would like this problem solved.

Upvotes are greatly appreciated and welcomed! Hopefully we can get AMD's attention and get this issue resolved.

Amd,"Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes). And we also now have Linux support for the FFmpegEncoders, so it might be worth it to try there as well!

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
        3. Test if the replay buffer works, for either encoder.
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster.",The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!

Amd,"So looking at various vendors Europe (mostly France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands), it struck me that a 6800 costs on average between 800-850 euro. the 6800XT is nearing the 900-1000 range.

What is up with these prices?? Is this normal pricing, or a capitalization on the demand? 

Prices for the 5700XT were never this bad, and were much better aligned with the MSRP in dollars. 

For comparison: The MSRP of 5700XT was 399 USD. You can get a pretty decent 5700XT for around 450 euros on average, which is fine, considering taxes here in Europe and what not.

Amd,"It's not working... At least not correctly.

My setup: RX 6800 -&gt; USB-C -&gt; USB-C IF certified cable -&gt; USB-C KVM -&gt; 8k DP cable -&gt; Monitor.

To set it up I connected another DP cable directly between RX 6800 and monitor.

Then I selected USB-C video out as main monitor and disabled DP output.

Then I switched monitor to the only active input.

So far so good. It works very nicely and mouse, keyboard and monitor work correctly. There is an issue with my USB audio driver having static noise after a few minutes but that's another issue.


The main problem however is that I am not able to restart my computer with just USB-C connected. The display stays black, USB devices however work correctly.


Before I had a 2070 super with USB-C and that worked flawlessly...

Is AMD aware of this issue and is anyone else experiencing this??

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro. So, in Germany you can get scalped with all the perks of buying directly from a retailer.

Given the fact that the price of most AIB 6800 XTs are at or higher than the RTX 3080s, is it even worth it to go for AMD this generation? I know that the 6000 series has made great leaps forward with raw rasterization performance, but given that they don't outright beat nvidia and the rtx cards offer DLSS and functuonal ray tracing, I have trouble seeing how one would go for a 6800 XT over a 3080.

**TL:DR**

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

So hold off from buying an older ryzen processor which I thought I was gonna have to do.

Amd,"Disclaimer: sorry if this is a little ranty.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted. 

What are your opinions?

Should I go for the 5800x or the 5900x?

Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

TLDR: If you a buying a Threadripper for Animation/3D Rendering. Go with a bigger cooler (360mm) and you’ll get much better results under extreme heavy load.

From what I've read up though, the latency on the 5900X is greatly improved from Zen 2 that this may be negligible. No one seems to have a 5900X and emulate via RPCS3, so I'm asking a more theoretical question but would this be correct? I also re-read Digital Foundry's review on the 2 chips and in 1080p, the 5800X seems to overall perform better there. I'm going to be using that resolution and don't plan on upgrading anytime soon as I also play 144 FPS, so would it be best for me to save $100 and get the 5800X?",How might a 5800X vs 5900X compare in RPCS3 as well as general gaming in 1080p?
Amd,"So I was one of the lucky few that got the 6800 xt, however I'm noticing a few problems with it after gaming with it for a while.   
There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

Originally, I went into the BIOS, turned on PBO and just went about my business. Recently, an NZXT cam update came out allowing me to monitor Zen 3 temps on my AIO LCD, and I noticed I was hitting high 80s while gaming. This seemed quite high, so I went and turned off ""Core Performance Boost"" as well as PBO in the bios and my gaming loads went to rarely breaking 60C.

Then I get the latest beta of MSI afterburner finally allowing me to monitor CPU while gaming. So I do some gaming and I realize that the CPU is pegged at 3400 mhz, so no boosting at all. I went and turned ""Core Performance Boost"" back to Auto, and now I'm boosting up to 4.9 ghz, but my temps are hitting 80C at times. It's worth noting that Ryzen master always reports a temperature that's anywhere from 0-9C lower than the temps reported by Afterburner and NZXT Cam. Pretty sure this is package vs core temp.

Should a 5950X with stock boosting be hitting 80C on a 360 AIO with fans (I know QL120 are crappy for rads) pegged at max? A few of my fellow 5950X owners are saying they have PBO turned on and are in the 60s while gaming?!",What are normal 5950X temps?

I backordered the 5900x on release day at the Burnaby, BC, CanadaComputers location. While paying for the backorder deposit, I naturally asked the employees to check how many people are ahead of me in line for the 5900x. An separate employee that wasn't helping me at the cash register proudly shouted out 'FIVE! There's 5 backorders so far'. (Back orders are per store and not linked with online order or other stores).

So I was quite content being with #6. Thinking on the next resupply I'll have a high chance of getting one. Today I walked in to buy a motherboard and check on the backorder queue/status. Guy that assisted me checked my backorder position and said I am **TENTH** in line. Now, I immediately knew what shady shit happened. Even though employee says they must've just made a mistake or system broken. I am certain that some shady employees fixed the backorder positions up for their friends or family.

There's no way that guy that so proudly shouted out (when not even being asked directly since his not the one assisting me) the amount of backorders their store got on the 5900x is wrong. On top of that, the way this employee checked and then whimpering-ly told me ""You are 10th in line"". It just screams to me that his not the one fixing the backorder positions but he knows it's been fixed by someone and others have came checking their backorder positions and he had to tell them the same shit. Then having deal with the angry customer after. Now I knew there's nothing I could do about it, so I just expressed how fucked up that was with a few words and then left.

Amd,There should be some means of denying warranty for products purchased from scalpers to de-incentivize the behavior. Maybe time gate it so that any warranty claim for a product that shipped from the manufacturer for 3 months after launch would require the original credit card number used to purchase(for the life of the warranty)? Maybe even have a launch SKU thats different then a post launch sku. This whole situation is bananas and if additional measures are not used to penalize purchased scalped products then sadly the current state we are in will happen again.,Preventing scalpers in the future

Just months ago, people on this sub said that high-end video cards are so expensive because high-end GPUs have high profit margins.

By contrast, consoles are so cheap because console APUs have low profit margin.

Now that AMD can't make enough GPUs (because AMD is allocating 80% of its wafer to consoles), all of a sudden, high-end GPUs have low profit margins and consoles have high profit margins.",The flip-flop that this sub does to defend AMD is pathetic
Amd,"I really really wanted to do an all AMD system, but after the last 10 days it became obvious to me that:

1. You have to be extremely lucky to get on retail
2. The AMD AIB pricing is ludicrous
3. It seems that the cards are going to rise in price

As a result, I decided that whichever I get first, be it a 3080 or a 6800Xt would be the card I get. If I hold out for AMD, whose launch also seems to be on tissue paper it could take me 6 months.

Funny thing is that I actually bought an EVGA FTW3 three weeks ago, but solid it because of all the horrible experiences people are having, and at the time I believed AMD and thought it would not be impossible to get a video card. Sold it at list price so I did not scalp. The guy who bought it (around 1 min after listing) was so happy and excited. It was cool. I don't regret selling it.

So I started scouring CL. I am in San Diego and there was a solid amount of ads. Some were from predatory scalpers, but those were easy to weed out. Most are well below the EBAY scalping level which I would never do but still really high. It seems a lot of people are getting preorders and EVGA queue orders in and had already found the card some other way. And several would negotiate. It's not a bad way to go with some effort but definitely some risk.

In the end I paid $970.

Seems expensive, but I noticed that BH has it at $799 but out of stock. And AMD has raised the price in their store to $849.

When I saw this it dawned on me that we might be entering another phase where all the GPUs sell for more than MSRP or original MSRP, and availability will remain ultra scarce. So my premium really wasn't all that much around $60-$70 considering tax.

Also the card is awesome. It is really really fast compared to my 1070 TI even with my i5-8400 processor (still waiting for some parts on my 5600X new PC though I have the processor. It is also DEAD silent even at load, and never got about 59 degrees in Time Spy (17556 graphics score so pretty decent)

I am just glad for it to be over. I wanted to support AMD but nothing about their launch is any more consumer positive than what what NVIDIA did.

If $849 is the new baseline, then considering tax and shipping I really did not pay much of a premium at all.",I gave up and went ASUS TUF 3080 OC
Amd,"Consoles will always sell. Most consumers don't care what brand is inside of it. The 6000 Series GPUs are competing with the latest nvidia offering. It's been 15 years or so since they have been this close on the high end. This was the best oppurtunity to grab a huge chunk of both mindshare and real consumers. Yields are great for the size of the gpu, but they still manage to be less available than Nvidia. 

Red Devil OC to 2.7Ghz at inly 335W That's fucking bonkers. This closes the gap between the the RTX 3080 and 3090 in some games. Stock 6800xt tied or slightly worse than 3080, to then tieing or beating 3090. Nvidia does not OC well at all this Gen and it can draw an insane amount of power. It infuriates me even more after seeing some of these AIB benchmarks. The 6900XT will be the halo product AMD has needed, but will be covered in a mostly negative light due to availability. 

I just had to get this out there. I pissed I probably won't get a 6900XT, but even more so that AMD have kneecapped themselves with this launch.",AMD made a huge mistake. This was their chance.

-ASROCK X-570 Steel Legend (Conflicting reports)

-ASUS X-570-P

*Boards that have issues with sound and other things*

-ASUS X-570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

-(Doing even more digging I found that even the boards that appear to work for most people can also have issues.)

I wanted to post this to try an make aware an issue a lot of us are experiencing in the VR space. We're hoping to get AMD's attention to try and see if there is anything they can do to help HP resolve the issues many of us are experiencing.

What is up with these prices?? Is this normal pricing, or a capitalization on the demand? 

Prices for the 5700XT were never this bad, and were much better aligned with the MSRP in dollars. 

For comparison: The MSRP of 5700XT was 399 USD. You can get a pretty decent 5700XT for around 450 euros on average, which is fine, considering taxes here in Europe and what not.

To set it up I connected another DP cable directly between RX 6800 and monitor.

Then I selected USB-C video out as main monitor and disabled DP output.

Then I switched monitor to the only active input.

So far so good. It works very nicely and mouse, keyboard and monitor work correctly. There is an issue with my USB audio driver having static noise after a few minutes but that's another issue.


The main problem however is that I am not able to restart my computer with just USB-C connected. The display stays black, USB devices however work correctly.

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p.

Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem.

**TL:DR**

All components of your Ryzen 5000 build might work out of the box even if your motherboard has AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/).

**TL:DR END**

This is my experience and I hope someone somewhere will find this useful.

Basically I had all of my PC components ready to go except my CPU ( Ryzen 5800x ).

My  motherboard is ASUS PRIME X570 P-CSM (No, it DOES NOT have a Bios  Flashback function) manufactured a few months back with BIOS version  2407 with AGESA [1.0.0.2](https://1.0.0.2/) which people say won't work on AMD 5000.

After completing my build thinking it definitely wouldn't work, I was surprised seeing it POST.

I immediately plugged in my pen-drive containing the latest Bios version ( 2816 ) at that time and updated it.

Now it's running flawlessly.

It  might or might not work for you but I'm just posting this here to tell  you there is a chance every component for your next ryzen 5000 build  will work out of the box.

So hold off from buying an older ryzen processor which I thought I was gonna have to do.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted.

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

Amd,"Truth be told, I like the motherboards for Threadrippers much more than any AM4 boards. I am toying with the idea of just getting an ROG Zenith Extreme II Alpha and dropping a 3960x into it. I like that I can load 128gb of RAM into it and upgrade to 256gb later. I want to use it for trading (stocks), gaming, content creation, and will likely use another PC to handle the streaming. Probably overkill, but is this a viable (albeit much more expensive) solution that will compete with Zen 3 architecture? Will I still get the advantages of having a 6900XT with a Threadripper as I would with a 5900x or 5950x? Also I might add another 6900XT down the road and will that work with Crossfire in any meaningful way? I know a bit, but this community has probably forgotten more about this than I'll ever be able to feasibly learn.

Amd,"Canadian CanadaComputers 5900x backorder status story.

&amp;#x200B;

I backordered the 5900x on release day at the Burnaby, BC, CanadaComputers location. While paying for the backorder deposit, I naturally asked the employees to check how many people are ahead of me in line for the 5900x. An separate employee that wasn't helping me at the cash register proudly shouted out 'FIVE! There's 5 backorders so far'. (Back orders are per store and not linked with online order or other stores).

So I was quite content being with #6. Thinking on the next resupply I'll have a high chance of getting one. Today I walked in to buy a motherboard and check on the backorder queue/status. Guy that assisted me checked my backorder position and said I am **TENTH** in line. Now, I immediately knew what shady shit happened. Even though employee says they must've just made a mistake or system broken. I am certain that some shady employees fixed the backorder positions up for their friends or family.

There's no way that guy that so proudly shouted out (when not even being asked directly since his not the one assisting me) the amount of backorders their store got on the 5900x is wrong. On top of that, the way this employee checked and then whimpering-ly told me ""You are 10th in line"". It just screams to me that his not the one fixing the backorder positions but he knows it's been fixed by someone and others have came checking their backorder positions and he had to tell them the same shit. Then having deal with the angry customer after. Now I knew there's nothing I could do about it, so I just expressed how fucked up that was with a few words and then left.

Somehow I wasn't too surprised, knowing even their store managers are scalping shit for themselves before anyone can even buy them.Some extra info he checked for me: (This is for Canada, BC)

There's 12 5900x in-transit to the Grandview CC store.

There's 8 5900x in-transit to the most of the rest of the CC stores. (Cool they just happen to have made me #10 in line huh)

Roughly 50 5900x in-transit to CC stores across BC. It will arrive in 1-2 weeks. Next batch zero ETA.

So if you backordered at a CC maybe check and re-secure your backorder position. Good luck F5ing or whatever it is people are doing now with alerts/bots to try and give amd/nvidia money.",Canadacomputers sus again- backorder line position changed

Amd,"Hello everyone,

yes, i know, AMD sad, that Ryzen 3000 would not be compatible with the Curve Optimizer. But to be completly honest, i doubt that.

It pains me to say this, but AMD has lied more and more the last few years. For example, the Cut for 300 series Boards, because ""Bios Chip too small"", PCIe4.0 on 300 and 400 series Boards, and the ""new manufacturing process from the 3000 XT series, which has fundamental other transistors than the normal 3000 CPUs"", which we also know, was a lie.

So, back to the point, there is literally no reason, that the curve optimizer would not work, when the only thing different between 3000 and 5000 chips is the Chiplet architecture, even the IO Die is exactly the same.",Ryzen 3000 with Curve Optimizer

At this point we all understand the supply issues and the extreme constraints that a global pandemic places on these companies. I don’t harbor any negative feelings towards either AMD or Nvidia, it’s just disappointing. I feel weird about recommending older GPUs right now. I don’t want my friends expectations to be let down in any way, especially when they are already spending 1k plus on their builds. Call me crazy but I think that spending  that much should get you an experience that is far superior to that of the series x/ ps5.

Amd,There should be some means of denying warranty for products purchased from scalpers to de-incentivize the behavior. Maybe time gate it so that any warranty claim for a product that shipped from the manufacturer for 3 months after launch would require the original credit card number used to purchase(for the life of the warranty)? Maybe even have a launch SKU thats different then a post launch sku.

Amd,"I really really wanted to do an all AMD system, but after the last 10 days it became obvious to me that:

1. You have to be extremely lucky to get on retail
2. The AMD AIB pricing is ludicrous
3. It seems that the cards are going to rise in price

As a result, I decided that whichever I get first, be it a 3080 or a 6800Xt would be the card I get. If I hold out for AMD, whose launch also seems to be on tissue paper it could take me 6 months.

Funny thing is that I actually bought an EVGA FTW3 three weeks ago, but solid it because of all the horrible experiences people are having, and at the time I believed AMD and thought it would not be impossible to get a video card. Sold it at list price so I did not scalp. The guy who bought it (around 1 min after listing) was so happy and excited. It was cool. I don't regret selling it.

So I started scouring CL. I am in San Diego and there was a solid amount of ads. Some were from predatory scalpers, but those were easy to weed out. Most are well below the EBAY scalping level which I would never do but still really high. It seems a lot of people are getting preorders and EVGA queue orders in and had already found the card some other way. And several would negotiate. It's not a bad way to go with some effort but definitely some risk.

In the end I paid $970.

Seems expensive, but I noticed that BH has it at $799 but out of stock. And AMD has raised the price in their store to $849.

When I saw this it dawned on me that we might be entering another phase where all the GPUs sell for more than MSRP or original MSRP, and availability will remain ultra scarce. So my premium really wasn't all that much around $60-$70 considering tax.

Also the card is awesome. It is really really fast compared to my 1070 TI even with my i5-8400 processor (still waiting for some parts on my 5600X new PC though I have the processor. It is also DEAD silent even at load, and never got about 59 degrees in Time Spy (17556 graphics score so pretty decent)

I am just glad for it to be over. I wanted to support AMD but nothing about their launch is any more consumer positive than what what NVIDIA did.

If $849 is the new baseline, then considering tax and shipping I really did not pay much of a premium at all.",I gave up and went ASUS TUF 3080 OC

To set it up I connected another DP cable directly between RX 6800 and monitor.

Then I selected USB-C video out as main monitor and disabled DP output.

Then I switched monitor to the only active input.

Amd,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share that I've got a Ryzen 5 2600 up and running on an MSI B550 Gaming Edge WiFi Motherboard. Here is a CPU-Z validation: [https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq](https://valid.x86.fr/ba58wq)

I'm creating this post, because I couldn't find enough information, if the motherboard will work with my CPU. Officially, the CPU is not supported by the motherboard (and from the B550 Chipset in general), but I found some comments here on Reddit and other forums that it might work, so I decided to give it a try. Here is what I had to do however, in order to get everything up and running.

Initially, the motherboard didn't boot with the Ryzen 5 2600. I decided to try and update the BIOS with MSI's Flashback to the latest BIOS version 7C91v14. With the CPU still in the socket, the Flashback didn't work as well, although theoretically it should work even with an installed CPU. The red LED for the Flashback blinked multiple times and then stayed solid for over 10 minutes and the other lights on the motherboard didn't light up, which meant that the Flashback isn't working.

I had to remove absolutely everything (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU) from the motherboard and leave only the 8 PIN CPU power connector and the 24 PIN power connector. After the BIOS flash, I installed the CPU, RAM, GPU and SSD and the PC booted without any problems. Everything (PCI-E Gen 3 including NVMe, SATA, XMP Profiles, WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) seems to be working fine for now. The CPU is also recognized in the BIOS correctly.

One small note about using the Flashback: The USB drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and an MBR scheme. The flash might not work, if the scheme is not MBR.

I mean, it was (and is) so bad that AIBs have taken it upon themselves to directly dig even further the Rx 6000 series with insane prices of the AIB models and some retailers in Europe are straight up scalping these cards despite having no stocks. 

Here in Germany, some retailers have gone out full scalping mode selling reference models for 900 euro and, for example, the  [**Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT OC SE**](https://www.csv-direct.de/artinfo.php?artnr=AGX1379345&amp;KATEGORIE=062) goes for an affordable price of 12,178.78 euro.

Hello all,

I am building my first pc but I have a dilemma: I can't decide on whether to get to 5800x or the 5900x.

The pc would be used mostly for gaming and work related activities. The wild card though is productivity.

My current setup is an old dual core MacBook so any use of photo editing, video editing, blender, etc. is a no go.  With the new pc I would want to try my hand at photo editing / creation and blender **as a hobby**.

This is where the biggest part of my problem is. Any major productivity task would be done as a hobby on my own time and I cannot guarantee that I will have the free time to spend or if I would want to pursue photo editing or blender or other productivity activities as a hobby long-term. I do not plan to upgrade until at least half-way into the am5 socket cycle (so not until at least 2024-2025 or beyond) and I do not know if in the future I will need a high core count CPU. 

Right now I am leaning towards the 5800x even though I know it is the worst price-to-core option. My worry is that I will not take advantage of the extra cores and threads of a 5900x and the extra $100 I spend would be effectively wasted. 

What are your opinions?

Should I go for the 5800x or the 5900x?

Thank you for all the help.",Help: Ryzen 7 5800x vs Ryzen 9 5900x
Amd,"Hey Guys,

If you also count to the ones who just want to have the 5800x before christmas check out the german Amazon. Send me a PM if you like the link because I think it is not allowed to post refferal links.

Only issue: MB is included (also in the price) + a premium of 100€ if you subtract the MB cost.

I bought mine yesterday and will receive it on wednesday and they are still in stock.",5800x available in german Amazon (with MB)
Amd,"I know AMD recommends a 750w psu, but I wanted to know if a 650w gold psu will work. And, I'm asking on the hypothetical of a ryzen 5 3600 and rx 6800xt (I know it's not exactly the most effective to pair it with a 3000 series chip).

Thanks.",Will a 650w gold psu be enough for a 6800xt?
Amd,"In late October my Professional Workstation died. It had a great 8 year run, and finally gave up after being pushed hard every single day since March. After looking into what it would take to build a modern Xeon + Quadro rig like I had previously, I decided the $15,000 price tag was far too much and began to build an AMD Threadripper + RTX 30 Series Rig (full specs will be below) but the one thing that vexed me was the cooling for the processor. After searching and searching I came across an article that tested the temperatures in Cinebench r20 saying they had peaks in the low 80s, I thought this was fine as it was 10-15 degrees under the 95 degree max temp, and I bought the cooler they used: Celsius+ s24. 
And it works fine. But over prolonged load in Cinema 4D it’s in the high 80s. Still within spec, but not super comfortable. I tried swapping out the stock fans for high pressure, high speed Noctua fans, and shaved off a degree or two.
In SideFX Houdini is where it really starts to choke. During a decent sized simulation cache, I hit peaks of 92 degrees. Still within spec, but now we are really uncomfortable. It’s notable that everything, At this point l, was working and within spec, just, on the razors edge of where I need it to bee so I don’t have to think about it.

So I decided to test out the Prime95 stress test. And calculate the raw and Delta T temps from my hottest CCD Die (CPU CCD7 (Tdie)).

I ran the test for ten minutes with AVX Instructions off. The peak Raw Temperature of CCD7(Tdie) was 93.8 degrees Celsius, and the Delta T (subtracting the ambient room temp of 24 degrees) was 69.8 Degrees. 

Not Great, but technically within spec.

But at this point I decided it was time to go to Micro Center and get an new all in one AIO (I am not comfortable building a custom loop, this is my first custom build) 

I settled on the NZXT x73.

I ran the same test, with the same air temperature, and got a Raw Temperature in CCD7(Tdie) of 84 degrees, with a Delta T of 60. 

Which I am pretty happy about. I think this is the best temps I am going to get without going with a custom loop, though I could strap the better high pressure fans to it and see if we get any better temps.

I would love to know what temps other people are getting in Prime95 on their Threadrippers with both All in One AIO, Air, and Custom loop coolers!

TLDR: If you a buying a Threadripper for Animation/3D Rendering. Go with a bigger cooler (360mm) and you’ll get much better results under extreme heavy load.

Amd,"I'm currently building my first PC and going all out. One of the things I want to do is emulate on RPCS3, but I hear it does best on single 8 core CPUs. From what I've read up though, the latency on the 5900X is greatly improved from Zen 2 that this may be negligible. No one seems to have a 5900X and emulate via RPCS3, so I'm asking a more theoretical question but would this be correct? I also re-read Digital Foundry's review on the 2 chips and in 1080p, the 5800X seems to overall perform better there. I'm going to be using that resolution and don't plan on upgrading anytime soon as I also play 144 FPS, so would it be best for me to save $100 and get the 5800X?",How might a 5800X vs 5900X compare in RPCS3 as well as general gaming in 1080p?
Amd,"So I was one of the lucky few that got the 6800 xt, however I'm noticing a few problems with it after gaming with it for a while.   
There are two problems, one of them may be specific to Black Ops Cold War. (max settings, 1440p for reference)   


First, It seems as though the clock speed of the GPU randomly drops to \~500-560 at random, lasts for about 15-20 seconds, drops my frames to \~50 and then goes back to normal. This has happened multiple times with multiple titles, (Overwatch, BOCW, warzone). I think I saw it happen in a Jayztwocents video as well when he was testing Control on it.  


Second, my frames in BOCW seem to randomly start capping at 90 after a few minutes of playing. At first I thought it was the same issue as the clock speed, but after keeping my AMD software open over multiple days, seems like this happens independently from the clock speed.

I've been using HWmonitor for my CPU temps, and I adjusted my fan curve as I was worried perhaps it was thermal throttling, however it's keeping at around 60C. I'm really not sure what to do about it, but I don't think this card's availability is high enough for many people to be experiencing the same issues as I can't find anything out online about it.",Problems with my 6800 XT
Amd,"Hey there,

I managed to get my hands on 5600x so cant decide which one of the two, I want the cooler to be quiet under load and have good cooling so which one of those two?

They both cost almost the same here in Croatia, thx!","What CPU cooler is better for 5600x, Dark rock 4 or Noctua NH-u12s chromax?"
Amd,And I’m happy,Holy shit rx580 metro exodus runs at ultra a 60fps
Amd,"I just want to say this CPU and GPU combo is amazing. I previously had a 3600 and was not too happy with the performance while playing Warzone. I was getting between 120-150 FPS on 1440P. My CPU was definitely bottlenecking the GPU, pretty much I think this can be said for any Zen 2 CPU. Now I am getting about 170-190FPS. Temps are around 70-73 and Idle is about 30-33. AMD did a great job and I am happy with the performance.

Amd,"Hello, currently I'm using the Ryzen 7 1800X on my X370 board with a RTX 2080 Super. Maybe it's time for an upgrade, because the cpu usage is really high to almost 100 %, while the gpu usage is only low. 

Can you recommend me some good Ryzen processors, which aren't that pricey? My budget would be like 360 $.

Thank you!!",Which Ryzen for Gaming?
Amd,"I've been looking for comparison between all of them. In this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XF-rirft8U you can see that lows in MW drops down to 100 while 5900x have much higher lows overall. Most benchmarks you see online are done in singleplayer where the performance between 5600x, 5800x, 5900x and 5950x would be more or less equal. In online games like BFV, PUBG, MW the difference could be much bigger since online multiplayer historically been more CPU demanding. So for 144 fps gaming 5600x might not be ""enough"". What do you guys think?","5600x isn't ""enough"" for 1440p /144mhz gaming?"

Amd,"So with the new gen cards out yet horrible supply, which is better for my needs? I have a 3950x and 64gb ddr4-3600 trident z neo. 

I’m new to computers and I only play Warzone. 240hz monitor to add. My main target is high fps on ultra 1080p settings. 

I’m not sure if Warzone uses ray tracing and dlss? If anyone can answer that, it would be helpful. Without and constrains on price, which would perform better? I don’t play nor plan on buying any pc games in the future except Cold War (ps5 for all my other gaming needs)

To add, I’ll be using obs or elgato to record gameplay.

Amd,"Hello everyone,

yes, i know, AMD sad, that Ryzen 3000 would not be compatible with the Curve Optimizer. But to be completly honest, i doubt that.

It pains me to say this, but AMD has lied more and more the last few years. For example, the Cut for 300 series Boards, because ""Bios Chip too small"", PCIe4.0 on 300 and 400 series Boards, and the ""new manufacturing process from the 3000 XT series, which has fundamental other transistors than the normal 3000 CPUs"", which we also know, was a lie.

So, back to the point, there is literally no reason, that the curve optimizer would not work, when the only thing different between 3000 and 5000 chips is the Chiplet architecture, even the IO Die is exactly the same.",Ryzen 3000 with Curve Optimizer

Amd,"Consoles will always sell. Most consumers don't care what brand is inside of it. The 6000 Series GPUs are competing with the latest nvidia offering. It's been 15 years or so since they have been this close on the high end. This was the best oppurtunity to grab a huge chunk of both mindshare and real consumers. Yields are great for the size of the gpu, but they still manage to be less available than Nvidia. 

Red Devil OC to 2.7Ghz at inly 335W That's fucking bonkers. This closes the gap between the the RTX 3080 and 3090 in some games. Stock 6800xt tied or slightly worse than 3080, to then tieing or beating 3090. Nvidia does not OC well at all this Gen and it can draw an insane amount of power. It infuriates me even more after seeing some of these AIB benchmarks. The 6900XT will be the halo product AMD has needed, but will be covered in a mostly negative light due to availability. 

I just had to get this out there. I pissed I probably won't get a 6900XT, but even more so that AMD have kneecapped themselves with this launch.",AMD made a huge mistake. This was their chance.
