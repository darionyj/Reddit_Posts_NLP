# Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* If you are having issue installing the driver for GTX 1080/1070/1060 on Windows 10, make sure you are on the latest build for May 2019 Update (Version 1903). If you are on the older version/build (e.g. Version 1507/Build 10240), you need to update your windows. Press Windows Key + R and type winver to check your build version.
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

# Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.",Game Ready Driver 457.30 FAQ/Discussion

nvidia,"Just got the video card but dont have all the pieces to put together the system yet so put in in my old system replacing a 1070Ti.

I thought people might be interested to see performance with an 2.5 Gen old 6 thread processor.

Performance is pretty amazing. No OC, using the quiet BIOS on the ASUS TUF card (OC version, though), the Graphics score in 4K was 17556 and overall 12852 with 5104 CPU score

Peak temp in the benchmark was 59 degrees.

Board is so quiet that it was inaudible during the benchmark at around 2 feet but if I put my ear like 6 inches away it was very slightly audible. Fans do not spin at all in normal desktop stuff.

In WOW at 4K and highest settings it was getting over 100 fps even in reasonably crowded areas. I saw may one or 2 small dips to like 90.

Only installed it about an hour ago. 

TLDR version it seems exceedingly playable even at 4K with an older (not really old) but only 6 thread processor. 

Already have the 5600X will be interesting to see how performance increases with 5600X and 16GB more memory.

FWIW I bought it off CL. There is certainly some risk but you can weed out the more predatory or professional scalpers from the add. I paid $970. ASUS has updated the price on their website for the board to $849 so when you consider tax and possible shipping I do not pay too much of a premium.

I did look and it seems Gigabyte provides 3 years warranty with the card - is that true? Is the card still under warranty, for one more year? Or did i need it to register on Gigabyte site those 2 years ago for that additional year to kick in? I actually did do that, well, at least with the other card, Gaming one, which did even have 4-year extended warranty - and when i login into my Aorus account one, i can see it there with 2 more years warranty left. But the Windforce card is there not listed at all. I dont remember whether i registered both (and Windforce is now gone from the list due to its 2-years warranty being over) or it allowed me to register Gaming only (as it boasted that Extended 4-years warranty).

I know that the ASUS non-OC seems to have better cooling than the EVGA, but not sure about the OC model. I also can't really find good performance data for how well it underclocks or overclocks compared to the FTW3. 

On my current EVGA card, undervolting outperforms stock in benchmarks, with 1980@.9V pulling 320w at 102% perf vs stock, or 1920@.85V pulling 290w at 98% vs stock, which pulls 388w. I can also OC +150 to get 105% vs stock perf pulling 410w. Real world gaming sees slightly less power draw than the benchmarks of course.

nvidia,"I know someone had [posted recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bestbuy/comments/k0z5se/best_buy_gave_my_3080_to_another_customer/) with a somewhat similar experience of trying to pick up a ""rare stock"" item that they had ordered to a store....I had a very similar experience as outlined in the saga below. Beware of shipping GPUs for store pickup....
       
**TL;DR;** I ordered a 3080 FE from Best Buy and the store received the item for my order, but an employee ""took it and sold it to ""another customer"" "". Now I'm left with nothing and the General Manager provided no real assistance throughout the experience.
     
**Context:** I had ordered one of the 3080 FE graphics cards. As you all know, it has only come back into stock a few times between the launch and November 10 (when I had ordered it) and even then, it was in stock for less than 5 minutes. I was able to successfully place an order to be picked up at a local Best Buy.
    
I was anxiously tracking my order and grew concerned when the initial expected pickup date came and the order was delayed. The status now said that the expected pickup date was November 20th, but if Best Buy couldn't fulfill the order then it would be cancelled. This was extremely concerning to me so I then chatted with corporate customer service via the Best Buy app every other day to confirm that there was in fact a unit in transit and they kept reassuring me that there was a unit on the way to the store and it would arrive by Friday, November 20th. I have all of the chat logs from these sessions.
    
November 20th arrives and I chat with Customer Service again, they tell me that the unit is on the way and is still expected to arrive on time that day, so I shouldn't worry about the order potentially getting cancelled. So I'm waiting waiting waiting for the status to flip to ""Ready for Pickup"" until finally later that afternoon, I received an email that the order officially got cancelled. I was furious and tried chatting customer service as they had promised me several times that the unit was in transit and the order wouldn't be cancelled, but I sat in the chat waiting queue for nearly 45 minutes and eventually the chat was taken offline for a period of time.
   
I chatted again the next morning on 11/21 and asked to speak with a supervisor. Once connected they did some research and confirmed that the unit did in fact arrive at the store the previous day at 10:30am EST and provided the UPS tracking info for confirmation. They suggested I call the store and see if the order had in fact arrived but just wasn't ""received"" yet. I tried calling on two phones simultaneously (one directed towards ""Customer Service"", with the other directed towards the ""Computers"" department). Both calls were on hold for 45 minutes with no one even picking up a phone to see what I was calling in regards to.
   
I ended up just driving to the store as I had another item to pick up, so figured I'd just ask in person regarding the issue. Customer Service told me they couldn't find anything nor could the warehouse employee that was working at the time. They asked me to leave my phone number and the manager would call me when he got in at 1pm that afternoon with more information.
   
Later that afternoon, the manager did call me and said that they never received anything and that I shouldn't be surprised as this item has been out of stock everywhere consistently. I explained I was well aware which is why I was looking into this so much as I'd been trying to order it since it launched in September. He told me ""there's nothing he could do as it's out of stock and he hopes I'm able to place another order soon"".
   
Yesterday, I stumbled across this [other Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bestbuy/comments/k0z5se/best_buy_gave_my_3080_to_another_customer/) and thought to myself...hmmm it's weird that Corporate Customer Service confirmed that the order was delivered but the store claimed they never received it, I wonder if something similar had happened to me.
   
Today, I went back into the store and asked to speak with the General Manager. The General Manager was the same manager I had spoken with on Saturday 11/21 over the phone. He remembered speaking with me and remembered my name attached to the order. I asked him for more detail about it and he said ""he did in fact discover that the unit tied to my order was taken by an employee and sold to another ""customer"" "". As a result, I was left high and dry with nothing in hand and a cancelled order. I'm not trying to jump to conclusions or make false accusations, but I'm extremely skeptical due to the rarity of stock that this unit wasn't bought by an employee for either personal gain or as a favor for a friend.
   
How in any way is that a fair experience? I went through the chaos of ordering the unit and was finally able to get an order placed successfully, have confirmation that a unit shipped/arrived in store, only to have an employee ""give it to another customer"".

Edit: 3080s have been restocked a few times since launch.

nvidia,"Hi all. I would like to preface this by saying that yes, I am a huge idiot for deciding to build a pc now. I need a new workstation, and new consoles are coming out, so I decided to build a pc since I am now fully remote wfh and have also saved a lot of money during quarantine. Yes this is also the reason every other person in the universe is building a PC right now. I didn't know what I was getting into when attempting to get a GPU. I have since purchased everything I need to build the machine, somehow I was able to get my hands on a Ryzen 5800x.

With my build being all white, I have my heart set on the Gigabyte Vision OC GPU (don't care if its a 3070 or 3080). This is probably one of the most sought after cards as well, as it's one of the only cards that is white. It also has great reviews from those who have benchmarked the card.

Here is the timeline of my mental decay:

1. When the 3070s first came out, I experienced the great Newegg crash on release day and wasn't able to get a card. Disappointing, but expected as this is the nature of getting a GPU this season.
2. I found a 3080 on ebay being sold with a 850W psu, which seemed reasonable (yes still above MSRP) at $1000. I won the bidding war for $1100, which I then payed for, only to have the seller contact me and say ""I have to cancel your order, as ebay is holding your payment from me until the card is delivered."" This is a completely normal policy on ebay, and the user then suggested he would send the card if I sent him the payment through ""CashApp"". Long story short, he cancelled my order and I wanted to yeet myself out of my apartment window.
3. I wrote a bot to scan websites to sound an alarm if any went in stock (no i didn't write a bot to actually buy up the stock, just to watch the sites for me). One morning at 4:15am, I woke to the alarm, only to get through the checkout process on newegg, which ended on a screen telling me that the item was no longer in stock.
4. The alarm sounded once again a week later, and I was able to purchase a 3070 card from best buy. I received a confirmation email, saying that my item should arrive at my nearest best buy store for me on Nov 25.
5. Nov 25th: No card arrives at the store. I get an email saying that there has been a delay and that if my item does not arrive by Dec 2nd, that Best buy would cancel my order. I spent 4 hours trying to get in contact with support, both through web chat and phone call, only to have them tell me no additional information, but that the manufacturer has not sent the item yet. It's currently thanksgiving, and I wont be able to get to the store by Sunday the 29th. 

My plan is to try and speak to the general manager on Sunday to see where the card is and to beg them to not cancel my order, and instead just wait until they can actually fill the order. I would rather wait than have them completely ditch me and go through this terrible terrible process again. My soul can't take it anymore.

nvidia,"Hello everyone, with Black Friday coming up I was looking to upgrade my graphics card! I am not very tech savvy at all, I got this computer 5 years ago prebuilt (yes, cringe) but it was a gift so I am looking for a bit of help in upgrading.

I was looking to upgrade my GPU only. My CPU is an Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40Ghzz and my GPU is currently an Nvidia Geforce GTX 745. Not sure if I need to list any other specs, if so please let me know. As I am not very tech savvy, I've been recommended by a few close friends that a 1660 super is a good, cheap upgrade. I am indeed looking to stream on twitch but it's more of a casual thing- I play my games on medium to low settings and am fine with it, the only reason I'm looking to upgrade the GPU is to stream. I'm not looking to spend too much on a GPU but here are my questions.

1. Is the 1660 Super good for my situation? (Just want to stream, don't need fancy graphics or anything considering my budget (around 350 dollars)
2. Where do you guys recommend finding a GPU (in my current case the 1660 Super) for a good deal considering it's Black Friday / cyber Monday coming up? Any recommendations? I've looked on amazon and Neweggs, do they have big sales? Are there any physical stores that I should try out for blackfriday like Bestbuy and such?

Thank you again very much ! Happy holidays

So I was on this sub in the launch day thread and around 7:55 a good Samaritan,(whoever you are, thank you) posted a direct link to the Nvidia store for the 3090 with the card in the cart.

Was sulking and disappointed again thinking id never get a card.


Unlike the 3080 launch, this was different. During the 3080 launch, I had a card in my cart and I would have a message that the card was removed because it was out of stock when I clicked submit and this time, the card was out of my cart but I didn't get a message.

I recently took the dive and overclocked my GPU, a 2070 Super Founders Edition. I was scared, not gonna lie hahah. But I have been overclocking my processor and thought I cant go wrong. I used MSI Afterburner and MSI Kombustor for stress tests and benchmarks, preferably the MSI Furmark benchmark/Stress test.

After much trial and error, MSI Kombustor crashing, fan curve adjusted properly (Didnt notice the fans like never kicked on before haha), my screen going black and TV telling me its disconnected, then it come right back (Straight up mini heart attack), I finally got my max clocks and mem clocks. I can go about 120+ on my Core Clock without stability issues or games not launching and about 600+ on the Mem Clock. I had it at about 170+/650+ playing Fortnite (and the max I think I got was 175+/800+ but noticed artifacting in gameplay, not on the benchmarks/stress test though) but then switched to Anthem, and it wouldnt launch until I dialed my Core clock -10 and Mem clock -50. Now everything runs, and I dont notice any artifacting. I did think that Anthem was running weird with an overclock, but forgot that Anthem is just not optimized and even dosent look the greatest with stock settings. Im also running 4k/60hz btw.

I went from a benchmark of 66FPS stock on MSI Kombustor using the MSI Furmark benchmark at 4k, but now have about 77 FPS after my tweaks and adjustments, and Fortnite runs in the 80-90+ FPS now instead of 65-75FPS that it was before.

***Tl;DR version -*** 120+ on my Core Clock, 600+ Mem Clock, power limit upped to 120%, Temp maxed to 88C is my overclock success on MSI Afterburner. 66FPS stock on a Benchmark, 77FPS after overclock, same benchmark; MSI Furmark preset 2160p using MSI Kombustor.

How would I know if this video card is not delivering enough for this monitor? Are there any tell tale signs? I used it for BF V for a bit and was able to get 90 fps on High settings with the screen much smaller than full screen, which was fine by me. I am not gaming anymore and just using it for the internet and stock charts. I haven't noticed any issues and it has performed well. I guess I am just curious would say a RTX 3080 deliver better 2D graphics (internet, stocks, etc) than a 1660 Ti or is the 3080 really only going to give me performance in the 3D areas.

Also how many monitors will my 1660 Ti drive before it's too much and how would I know? It has 1 Display Port and 2 HDMI so technically it can support 3 monitors.

Should it be a 3080 for 960$

nvidia,"Three weeks ago, I found a 3070 listed at 680€ on some website. Ecstatic, I immediately ordered.

 Fast forward 3 weeks. 

No GPU in sight. “Screw it” I think to myself. To pay 160€ more and to not even get it REMOTELY on time? I decided to cancel the order, but found out my brother wanted it and was willing to wait and pay. Ok. 2 days ago, they end up canceling it.

I want to wait for the prices to reach the actual price (of 520€ on the Nvidia website which is more expensive than in the US but what can you do) and would like to know how much I should expect to wait.

Paying 35% more just to get it canceled 3 weeks later is high street robbery, and even though I can afford it, I can’t accept spending that much more than the actual price, plus, I don’t want to reward price gouging.

From experience, could anyone please estimate how much time I should expect to wait before either:

1. Stock on the Nvidia website holds steady, I buy it directly from them

2. 3rd party prices fall down. I don’t expect them to cost as little as the Nvidia ones, but I would still buy if the difference was small.

And I'm wondering, as my current 1070 almost touches the motherboard, I'm wondering if the 3070 might be to big. It's not really possible to check measurements since they don't give them out, only length, height and width. I'm curious if the actual connector is further out on some cards. Because if they are there is a chance the new card might not fit.

As seen on the picture, that is where it almost touches. like by less than a mm off from touching. So if the connector is further in on the new card it probably wont fit. Do I have to worry?

Looking to upgrade my TV, would love some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

In currently have a LG Oled [55EG910V](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/452109/lg-55eg910v-zwart/specificaties/). 1080p 60Hz max. Bought in 2015. Only input is my PC with an MSI 2070s GPU.

I am looking to upgrade the TV to the LG [55CX6LA](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1540272/lg-oled55cx6la-zwart/specificaties/). 4k, 120Hz, HDR, G-Sync compatible.

Mainly to game at a higher refresh rate / fps; 1440p@120Hz. But also occasionally watch 4k content. 

I also use the pc for browsing (such as now on Reddit:)

To not have the bottleneck of HDMI 2.0b on the 2070s. I want to use this [HDMI to DP adapter](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1557754/club-3d-displayport-14-to-4k120hz-hdr-active-adapter-zwart/specificaties/).

I am ok to set the resolution a bit lower (1440p) in favor of a target fps of 120. I also am aware that, certainly with the 2070s, 4K gaming isn't an option.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

* Is the above mentioned configuration ok for what I want to achieve? Any advice would be very welcome.
* How do I best 'combine' 4k content viewing with 1440p gaming? Will I use 1440p@120Hz as a base setting in Nvidia control panel, and switch to 4k when viewing movies/series?
* Will using 1440p as the standard resolution in Nvidia settings (instead of the 'native' 4k), result in detrimental image quality? Unclear image? Under the specs of the CX, 1440p is listed as 'native'.
* What is the preferred setting for Nvidia Color settings? RGB or YCbCr 444? Full or Limited? 8 or 10 bpc?

I bought my PC some 7 years ago and my GTX 780 fried on me a couple of weeks ago (along with my PSU) while playing Outer Wilds. I'm not in a very good spot money wise, and I live in Brazil. The USD to BRL conversion rate is \~5.40 nowadays and GPUs are kinda hard to find here, also, some prices don't make a lot of sense.

I plan to upgrade my PC someday, but the truth is it's impossible right now. But I want to keep playing my games for now at 1080p and at least 60fps (The heaviest games I want to play right now are Death Stranding and RDR2. I don't play online games at all.)

My specs)i7-3770k (No OC, but recently bought a cooler (gammax 400v2) and I'm thinking about trying to)  
PSU: CX550 Corsair  
8gb ram Corsair Vengeance  
My monitor is 1080p

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  
I'm deciding between GPUs for 1080p single player gaming.   
Here in Brazil, I found:  
1650 for \~$270 dollars  
1660 Supers for \~$333 dollars  
RTX 2060s for $400 \~ $462 dollars  
Two RTX 2060 Supers (A Zotac AMP one and a MSI Super Ventus GP) for \~$481 each.

I WILL buy a GPU until the end of the year. Do you guys think one of these are worth it? The prices aren't going down for months at least (and maybe will even go up).

I seem to be having an issue getting the EVGA Precision X1 software's OSD to work, so  I managed to get RTSS + HWINFO working and I am monitoring some information about my card.

I'm looking at reviews of 3080 cards, and it says that they run with core clock speeds of 1700-1900 mhz.

The only changes I made in EVGA Precision X1 is adding a custom fan profile and changing the RGB settings, and I'm wondering how to understand the clock speed.

For clock speeds, it ranges between 1800mhz and 2010mhz.  For memory clock speeds, it says 2376mhz and this number does not change.

nvidia,"Hi, I need some advice (and clarification) about power supplies and needs specific to ampere.

&amp;#x200B;

I have this power supply:

[https://www.evga.com/products/specs/psu.aspx?pn=e7a4ca30-cc2f-4769-b8ac-4293f30e7820](https://www.evga.com/products/specs/psu.aspx?pn=e7a4ca30-cc2f-4769-b8ac-4293f30e7820)

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions to start off:

Am I correct to assume that a single rail power supply automatically means it only has a single pcie power cable coming out of it for the gpu? If not, can anyone clarify how this works? I'm probably very wrong on this.

I remember single rail power supplies being considered 'better' a few years ago?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This psu only has one pcie power cable coming out the back (it's non modular), which splits into 2 6+2 connectors.As far as I'm aware this has always been considered just fine even for heavily overclocked 1080ti and 2080tis or heavily overclocked amd cards (like oc 390x back in the day with its silly high 500+ watt peak power spikes)

&amp;#x200B;

Would this be a problem for the rtx 3070? I vaguely remember something about seperate pcie cables being recommended at launch but I haven't kept up.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone happen to have experience with this particular power supply combined with an rtx 3070 or 3080? or a similar power supply?

Maybe some of the nvidia reps who post/lurk here has a more definitive answer.

For some reason, when you have a custom fan curve set through Afterburner on the card, and you have the fan speeds at 45% or below, the fans will intermittently stop and start briefly.  The fans will be running, and then all of a sudden GPU-Z will report 0 RPM and nothing on the graph for that brief moment before it starts again.  Any percentage above 45 seemed to alleviate the issue for me.  Not sure exactly what causes it but I thought it was worth mentioning here.

edit: Now I'm thinking maybe the issue is with Afterburner rather than the card itself.

edit2: Just going to post this here in case people don't read the comments.  From alterexego who responded with this comment;

""Yes, the Trinity does the same thing. It's because the minimum RPM of the fans is around 650. If your software tries to set it below that (ignore what percentage that is, the fan hardware does not care about %, just raw voltage/PWM signals) the fans start/stop.

It's just a hardware limitation of the fans. Many PWM fans will not run properly under a certain threshold.""

Just wanted to put in some interesting findings I had.

So recently I upgraded from i7 8700k in a z390 asus MB to a Aorus master x570 and a AMD 5900 cpu. I have a aorus master 3080 with a “thermal take PREMIUM riser cable for both setup.

Now I’m not much of a benchmark person or overclocker, I tend to OC my cpu and generally leave gpu as factory defaults. But I do run timespy just to give me a baseline and see if there is any issues. 

Anyhow during the upgrade I updated the MB bios and made sure to set the motherboard settings to pcie 3 as I heard there is bosd issues using a pcie 4 MB/GPU with a pcie3 riser cable. And the TT riser cable only says pcie3.

Anyhow everything gets installed and I run a timespy, in the previous setup I got around 17800 graphic score on timespy, however now suddenly I only barely manage to get to 16020, I proceed to OC only to get maybe 100 or so on the score.

Scratching my head, i reinstall the gpu/drivers/ check all settings that can effect benchmark (power etc) but in the end best I managed was 16230 give and take.

So as a last ditch effort I went back into the bios and changed pcie back to gen 4, and ran the benchmark with default gpu settings and boom 18200. Well that’s interesting... I’d though I get a bsod or something.

Now it’s been about 2 weeks of gaming and production left as pcie 4 and so far no errors or any issues. Leaves me to believe the thermal take premium cable is capable of pcie4?

My question is - I have read that the 3080 requires 3 cables from the PSU - will they be included with the modular PSU or should I order some extras? Don't want to get to assembling this weekend and realise I don't have the correct cables!

Also if you don't mind another more general question (might be better placed on build a PC) - am I missing any non-obvious components from the list that will prevent me from assembling and getting it up and running? I have a USB stick with windows ready to go and ordered some thermal paste in case it is required.

I need more storage space but I have some old slow drives to add for now.

Just a few quick questions about the AIB cards for the RTX 3000 series. I'm in Australia, if it makes a difference.

-Is the markup over the founders edition or MSRP (Think it was about 1200 AUD, 700 USD for the 3080) normal? It's super difficult to find a RTX 3080 under 1000 USD, for example. (It's difficult to find them at all but you get what I mean)

-What's the difference between the different models? Take Asus for example - what's the difference between the Dual OC, TUF Gaming, ROG Strix? Just the cooler? Better binning? Meaningful improvement in power stages? If so, how much of a difference would it make if you were to just slap a waterblock or G12 onto a cheaper one?

-On the same note, what's the difference between say the Asus TUF Gaming and TUF Gaming OC? Again, binning, or better power targets? There's a 100 USD difference between them where i'm looking, and if it's just that the OC one has had like +40 on core pre-applied in afterburner...

-Where do the new Gigabyte Eagle cards fit into the product stack? I always though it was turbo/blower for lower end, Gaming OC for middle, and AORUS if you have all together too much money.

Can you run 4K, HDR, and Variable Refresh Rate simultaneously on the Predator CG7 (or similar HDR GSYNC Compatible displays)? Does enabling one disable the other? How much difference will a casual gamer pick up on between the two?

nvidia," Hey folks,

So I figured I'd share my results for people who wanted to learn something new, or to help those of you who were wanting to update their RTX 3070 vbios in order to increase their power draw and performance.

My card: [MSI RTX 3070 Ventus 3X](https://www.newegg.ca/msi-geforce-rtx-3070-rtx-3070-ventus-3x-oc/p/N82E16814137601) \- ([Spec from MSI page](https://www.msi.com/Graphics-Card/GeForce-RTX-3070-VENTUS-3X-OC/Specification))  
Initial bios version: [Ventus 3X OC Vbios version 94.04.25.40.41](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/226136/msi-rtx3070-8192-200914)  
Initial power draw: Both limit and target were locked at **220W**

Vbios version updated to: [Asus TUF OC 94.04.25.40.E9](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/226037/asus-rtx3070-8192-200925)  
New power draw specs: Target is **240W** while Limit is **270W**

Software used to update vbios: [NVFlash 5.667.0 from TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-nvflash/)  
Note: I used code line ""nvflash --protectoff"" during the process because of updating from one brand to another brand of gpu.  
Guide available: [Overclockersclub how to flash RTX bios](https://www.overclockersclub.com/guides/how_to_flash_rtx_bios/)  
In the guide you would be typing ""nvflash"" instead of ""nvflash64"" because that's the new filename

Right! Moving on to the results now! Did it work? Well here it is:

Initially my power limit was locked at 220W, however after the vbios update I could go to **112%** in MSI Afterburner and the power draw did increase exactly according to TUF's power draw specs. I have screenshots with details that I will be sharing with you.

So already I could notice an increase in performance without changing anything, because my power **target** had changed from 220W to 240W, and this was reflected in the images which I will show you. Also, initially I had found a stable overclock which was +115clock speed and +480mem in MSI afterburner. Once I updated to the new vbios, my clock speed could still not go higher than +115, however this is misleading because the clock boost specs in the vbios of TUF is actually higher than the boost clock within MSI Ventus' vbios (from 1755Mhz boost to 1815Mhz boost from TUF's vbios). Therefore I believe even by keeping my overclock at +115, my boost clock was now higher than before. Someone could correct me if I'm wrong, however based on performance this is what it feels like. Unless only the power increase by itself could cause performance increase. In any case, let's move on to those screenshots.

*\*All benchmarks are done at 1440p. Also SOTR= Shadow of the Tomb Raider.*  
Power specs when kept at 100% power, +115clock, and +480mem:  
[SOTR Benchmark 104FPS result at Ulta and Medium Ray Tracing](https://i.imgur.com/uOSALhy.gif)  
You can see that the max power draw is **245W**, which is around the target of the TUF's vbios.  
So already by not changing anything, my benchmark was up to **104FPS**, whereas before it was somewhere **around 94FPS**. Good results.

Power specs when increased to 112% power, +115clock, and +700mem:  
[SOTR Benchmark 106FPS result at Ultra and Medium RT](https://i.imgur.com/Si6IXDd.gif)  
As you can see, the max power draw is now reaching **275W**, which is pretty cool.  
Interestingly, the boost clock also increased by 15, to 2145Mhz instead of 2130, even though I did not touch the clock speed.

Power specs at 112% power, +117clock, +700mem:  
[Game crashed near the end, however boost clock went up to 2160Mhz](https://i.imgur.com/yGAGJTN.gif)  
It seems even though I increased the boost clock by only +2, the boost clock had increased by 15.  
However I brought it back down to +115 for stability.

Power specs when increased to +120clock: No power specs retrieved, PC black screened and restarted near the end of the benchmark.

So it seems my clock speed was still perfectly stable at +115clock. However again keep in mind that it's still a higher clock speed than before because of the changed boost clock speed from TUF's vbios.

Benchmarks from AC Odyssy weren't very consistent but I included them anyway.  
Power specs with Assassin Creed Odyssy:  
Power 100%, +115clock, +480mem: [80 AVG FPS, 31 min and 139 max](https://i.imgur.com/b6c2rPc.gif) (interestingly boost went up to 2145Mhz even at 100% power).  
Power 112%, +115clock, +700mem: [82 AVG FPS, 34 min and 175 max](https://i.imgur.com/3dLXn9z.gif)  
For some reason the Odyssy benchmarks only push the power draw to around **250W** max, which is curious.

So overall, is it worth it? Answer: **Yes**, definitely!

Hope this helped. Make sure to always save your current vbios before attempting any vbios updates (it tells you how in the guide - the code is ""nvflash -b backup.rom"").

I have played a few VR titles however I hadn't used an fps measuring tool as I hadn't bought it (since have). So by all means request these also.

In my case, I have...

3080
I7 8700k
16GB 3000mhz Corsair Vengeance RAM
970 Evo SSD

Playing at 2560x1440 on an Odyssey G7. 

I won't provide a full breakdown on every single title I have played, but I'll go in relatively in depth on the titles I recall. I'm no Digital Foundry, so please don't expect this but I'd say I'm relatively adept at understanding the basics that people actually care about. So here goes... 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ghost Runner

All ultra, and I believe DLSS was off but don't quote me on that. Well above 140fps scraping 200 in sections. Overall, it was stunning.

As soon as I turned Raytracing on, I was dropping to just over 50 fluctuating to 60 here and there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death Stranding

Just because this was thrashing fps, I decided to hook this up to my 4K HDR TV, and cranked everything to the max along with DLSS. Amazingly, we hit 60fps consistently (my TV can only do this). While generally this is a low fps, the performance and look of the game is just brilliant, and reminds me of the 3080s worth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assassins Creed: Valhalla

Valhalla doesnt actually feature any kind of Raytracing, which surprised me! However it's still a stunner. Considering my awful performance in Legion I expected similar if not slightly better performance in Valhalla. That said, everything cranked up netted me 80+ fps in 2560x1440. Again, I tried this in 4k and managed roughly 50-60 with settings down to high/very high. Weirdly Valhalla features no DLSS support, but hopefully it gets added down the line. Raytracing might be asking a bit much. In all its hard to dispute Valhallas smooth performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watchdogs: Legion

Honestly, this was a joke. Whether I played in Medium, High, Very High or Ultra, whether I put DLSS on and whether I put Ray Tracing on, I was always hitting between 40-70 fps. Ridiculous considering this game was supposed to be a benchmark for the 3080. Don't get me wrong, the game is absolutely stunning! But I'm not about to keep playing it in its current state. In all, it needs some serious post support. Ubi did post an update recently saying they were working on it, but time wil tell. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so in all my experience so far has been really positive bar Watchdogs. I have gone from a 1080ti and the performance improvement has honestly been massive in my eyes. I really hope developers give these cards the love they need, because they truly deserve it.

Apologies for the vagueness of this, I really just wanted to hear peoples thoughts but figured since I was one of the lucky ones, I could maybe help those waiting and give you a slight preview of what you may be running into.

I have a native 4k monitor so initially ran the test with 
2160p

Rtx high
Dlss balanced
And got like 28fps so tried dlss performance and it wasnt much better.


I then tried rtx normal and dlss performance and got 38fps.

I then went down in res to 1600p and rtx normal dlss performance and got like 77fps and i couldn't notice any difference in image quality.

(Im aware that you can set custom resolutions but hoping cyberpunk has a res scale and could set it somewhere around 80 to get an 1800p resolution then run dlss and it upscale to the 1800p but have no game to test that has dlss 2.0 and a res scale to see if they can be stacked.)

Anyway.... I then ran the benchmark in 1440p and then in 1080p and both still looked great just like they did in 4k which I dont understand because when I play rdr2 or scum or any other title in 1440p it looks like a murky mess because of my 4k monitor.

Whats going on in this benchmark where 1440p and lower still looks great on my 4k monitor?

It would interesting to see what the results are, memory is main difference between the GPUs and once this is removed it would give us a clearly picture on what Ampere can do vs Turing. Also if you can try to match cards of equal caliber, like 3070 FTW3 Ultra vs 2080ti FTW3 Ultra, or a strix vs strix or at-least a somewhat close card (best if you can do 2 stock cards with stock clocks). What do you think the results will be, personally I think the 3070 will basically always win, it seems like memory bandwidth is it’s main weakness over the 2080ti and once you remove that, it basically becomes the better card (as long as Vram isn’t maxed out).",Can someone test 3070 and 2080ti with the same memory bandwidth and share the results

The 3080 also would not sync, and stayed on rainbow mode. This didn't bother me as much as the ram because the rgb on it is small and partially obscured by a cable.

1) Make sure the BIOS is the latest version

nvidia,"Hey all,

Thought I'd share some of my experience that might be helpful for others on the sub.

Managed to snag a Gigabyte 3080 Gaming OC at \~12:34am ET on 11/13, and at that time it had a delivery estimate of December 3-6th.

A few days later, the estimated delivery time was removed, which was scary.

During this time, I was also leaving myself open to ordering a 6800 XT and canceling if the reviews were that different, but felt the slightly higher price / perf from my research and watching a few of the more in-depth reviews for both, and product-level reviews for the 3080 Gaming OC gave me comfort/excitement to keep my order as-is (especially as some of the earlier pin connector issues have been resolved in later batches). Birds in the hand etc.

It also helped that I wasn't able to get a 6800 XT on launch or in the days after, which made my decision easier, especially after CDPR released some of the newer RTX-on gameplay for Cyperpunk 2077 which is one of the main reasons I'm upgrading my rig.

A few days later my shipping date was populated again, for December 6th, which was annoying but better than nothing.

Earlier this week, I was happy to see it updated to November 30th, which would have been a great thing to come back to from Thanksgiving to.

Yesterday, I got an email saying delivery will now be this Sunday (11/22), which was great to hear - and I thought worth sharing if it means the AIB stock situation is getting better.

I'm planning to give it a couple of days after delivery for Amazon to send the COD code - and will follow-up with them if I still haven't received it at that time.

So, normally you'd say the 2070 is better because it's a higher number. However, the 2070 is throttled while the 2060 is not. 

Obviously, the 2060 model is cheaper, so what I guess I'm really asking is if the 2070 *max-q* is worth the money over the (laptop) 2060 model, or if it's not worth the $200.

1. AAA titles - Fast forward a couple of years when new games are out. 

* Chances are you aren't running at 120+ FPS anymore so you'll drop quality/textures settings in favour of frames.  
* Very possible DLSS support will improve this so you render at lower resolutions anyway.

If you don't want to give PC Gamer any traffic here is the update on the article:

&amp;#x200B;

**Update 11/19:** After this article was posted, an Nvidia representative reached out to stress that Nvidia ""is not pushing proprietary ray tracing features in any games."" As I wrote above, AMD and Nvidia both have a history of introducing technology that exclusively works on their graphics cards. Right now, Nvidia is adamant that ray tracing won't follow that path:

""We support all industry standard APIs, including Microsoft DXR and the upcoming Vulkan RT, which is not yet released. The vast majority of games released with ray tracing support use the industry standard Microsoft DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) API. Three exceptions we are aware of include Quake II RTX, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and JX3, which use NVIDIA ray tracing extensions for Vulkan. But those extensions are necessary to get the standard released, and other venders can choose to support the NVIDIA extensions or not.  They are not ‘proprietary’. Quake II RTX and Wolfenstein YB utilize our Vulkan extensions since Vulkan RT is not out yet. AMD could write extensions for Vulkan if they wanted to spend the resources doing so. Once Vulkan RT is publicly ready, we would have no reason to use extensions and we will move to Vulkan RT.""

Then, from the all 3 HDMI ports on the card, I tried the first one and voilà, everything has been running as it should. 4K@120 RGB 4:4:4 with G-Sync ON and HDR ON. For those wondering, I did not connect the HDMI cable to the first port, because it is close to case frame, because of my vertical mount.

I have looked at the Gigabyte site in the spec sheet and there is nowhere written the HDMI port specification, thus I assumed, that all would have HDMI 2.1.

Please upvote this post, so somebody from Gigabyte/Aorus would answer this, as I think this is pretty scammy practice.

EDIT: Should as well note, that yes, I have the latest LG firmware, latest GPU drivers and yes, the cable is really 8k/HDMI 2.1 capable. The only issue here are the HDMI ports 2 and 3 on the card.  


EDIT 2: I just realised, that it can as well be the BIOS version of the GPU just not working properly with the remaining ports. So before I will go on Gigabyte bashing train, I will wait until somebody from Gigabyte responds here.

TLDR: your milage might vary but you gain more than you loose IMHO.

Results speak for themselves

[Results](https://preview.redd.it/jiltkswujgr51.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b35467da1f6d0f691216e3b026d66b1273cb2871)

Edit: Temp/max W and Throttle are from Port Royal stress test after about 10 minutes. The Benchmark was always cooler and faster.

*These results were obtained with MSI Afterburner 4.6.3 Beta 2 and Nvidia Driver 456.55*

If you want to give it a try the steps are pretty easy:

1. Reset Afterburner
2. Unlock voltage control in the settings
3. (optional) Set a custom Fan profile
4. Open the Clock graph with CTRL+F
5. Select your target voltage and drag it to the desired clock speed
6. Shift+click and drag to select all the ""dots"" to the right of your ""dot"" and drag them down so they are not above your selected speed. Should look like this

https://preview.redd.it/9nipltkolgr51.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27b1f6527855a4c817763e6f1d1757302857cb65

7. Drag the power slider to 115%

8. Click Apply

Now you can run you Benchmark / Stress test / Game

If it crashes then either reduce the clock speed by 15 or keep it but go one ""dot"" higher.

&amp;#x200B;

Some Observations:

Even if you set a clock speed the boost algorithm will still boost up to 2 bins (30MHz) up or down. This can lead to crashes. From my results 800mV @ 1770MHz is stable , but it boosts to 1800MHz when it pleases. If I clock it to 800mV @ 1800MHz it will become unstable because it tries to boost to 1815 and 1830. Some Frequencies do not do this and stay stable .... shrugs

The stock settings are very generous with the voltage. If you look at the table you can see that undervolting to 912 mV and 1920MHz is basically the same performance wise but runs cooler.

Benchmarks are not gaming results. I can go crazy with the clock speeds for 1 minute and get a nice benchmark score. But nobody cares about the FPS you get in the first minute before the card throttles down.

nvidia,"This is my story and not everyone has the same circumstances but I figured it might help some people actually get the cards of their dreams faster (hopefully before Cyberpunk 2077 drops). 


There are two major online shops in Poland that have massive preorders for 30XX cards (around 400-700 for each SKU) with people in virtual queues for almost 2 months now.

I approached both and got the same answer, we don't know when you will get a card if you order today. They don't even know if it will be this year and from the amounts they get right now (couple of cards for each SKU per shipment) and the amount of backorders it just didn't look good.


But I found info on a Polish equivalent of reddit (wykop.pl) that a different shop (retail mostly but with online presence) supposedly gets shipments from time to time but since it doesn't allow preorders it's on a first come first serve basis. Shipments are usually done Monday &amp; Thursday but the stock is updated at night around 2-3am.


So I setup UptimeRobot for this shop plus a couple of others and for around 4 SKUs that I was mostly interested (TUF, Ventus, Gaming OC and Zotac) totalling around 14 monitors. Each of them pointed to a fresh email address that was refreshed on my phone as much as possible with a VIP notification (configurable in most email clients) long and loud enough to wake me up.


Long story short, last night at 02:30 I got notified that TUF and Ventus should be available. I opened both links as fast as possible but unfortunately each was already sold out. I went back to sleep with ideas of how this setup wasn't perfect since at worst case it has 5min+5min delay from changes to the store and me getting notified.

At 3am I get another notification from the same store this time about Zotac and I actually could buy the card, however it was massively overpriced and from my research the worst choice for 3080. So I didn't buy it but I was happy that my setup proved useful and got me that chance. 


Around 05:30 I get another notification, this time about Gaming OC being available (same shop) and this time it is a bit more pricey than other shops (those with queues) but only by about 20$ which seems reasonable amount to pay for getting the card before 2021. After a short deliberation, during which I get around 9-10 messages that somebody just bought this item, I finally decide to pull the trigger and get me my first high end card very close to its debut. 


Just got the confirmation they already packaged it for transport and it should arrive tomorrow or on Sunday.

nvidia,"Hello! I am the creator of the performant, open-source and cross-platform Fast Fourier Transform library for Vulkan - VkFFT ([https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT](https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT)). In this post I will perform analysis of memory overclocking results of RTX 3090 on VkFFT/cuFFT benchmark. Results are provided by u/[Indoranyon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Indoranyon/)  in the comment section of this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/jwd0yv/help\_request\_for\_vkfft\_benchmark\_on\_rtx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/jwd0yv/help_request_for_vkfft_benchmark_on_rtx/)

The benchmark consists of 1D batched C2C FFTs followed by inverse C2C FFTs. Multiple iterations of this algorithm are performed consecutively to remove dispatch call overhead, then average time required to complete the benchmark is calculated. Full test is performed 3 times to check for outliers. For each system benchmark score is calculated as system size (the total size of the buffer the system takes on the GPU) divided by time taken to complete one iteration. The final benchmark score is calculated as an averaged performance score of all systems used. Results:

1. Benchmark proves once again that FFT is a memory bound task on modern GPUs. Core overclocking form stock by 250MHz didn't improve results at all. Averaged benchmark score for VkFFT went from 158954 to 159580 and for cuFFT  from 148268 to 148273.

2)Judging by power consumption, cuFFT reaches 300W, while VkFFT stays near 220W, which is kind of interesting and unexpected. Different performance modes and power limits do not affect the benchmark score, if nvidia-smi outputs are correct. I also don't know the details of the cooling system used in the test, but temperatures peaked at 23°C for VkFFT and at 30°C for cuFFT (note: these are GPU temperatures and not memory).

3)Memory overclocking. The most interesting part. The base clock of RTX3090 is 9750MHz (which should be effectively multiplied by 2, as it uses PAM4 modulation). However, in CUDA base clock used is 9500MHz. The benchmark score scaled according to the following graph:

https://preview.redd.it/os5jdlukoc061.png?width=4500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9c4b095e22f508b17de2e815e51cc0fc6c19c0

It can be seen that both libraries scaled similarly, but CUDA has a more stable line. Acheved results show that VkFFT gains 4.5% of performance per 1GHz overclocked (or per 10% of initial clocks). cuFFT gains 5.4% of performance per 1GHz overclocked.

As I know how much memory is transferred in VkFFT during each iteration, this value can be computed by simply dividing the amount of transferred memory by the iteration time. For different clocks bandwidth scales according to the following plot:

https://preview.redd.it/7e5o6gfkpc061.png?width=4500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef63a2349d1764a3fa4abf6695cc951352448030

Here VkFFT gains 35GB/s of bandwidth per 1GHz overclocked. Or, in other words, 4.6% of initial bandwidth per 10% of initial clocks.

The performance curve gained between 0 memory overclock and 3750 MHz for different systems looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/wbncte6krc061.png?width=4500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=671862b1e2a9560fc8ae4ad461856345377778c7

On average, the benchmark score experienced 17% improvement for VkFFT and 20% improvement for cuFFT.

\-cuFFT uses \~300 more MB of VRAM on all systems (note, VkFFT doesn't really need to allocate additional 1GB on systems where it uses more memory than cuFFT in the report, it is my bad that I didn't perform a check wether it is required in the latest version. Also, VkFFT has a low memory requirement option that cuts the memory used in half, but doesn't do reordering of big sequences - it is very useful for convolutions as they return to original layout automatically)
